  How do you get from Maxwell's equations to the design of a functioning, magnetic machine?  Participants in this program explore the physics and engineering behind motor and generator design and optimize the design of a prototype turbine being built by a local energy company in this weekly seminar. Comfort with multivariable and vector calculus and basic electricity and magnetism is required.
