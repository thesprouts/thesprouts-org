  How do you get from Maxwell's equations to the design of a functioning, magnetic machine?  Participants in this program explore the physics &amp; engineering behind motor &amp; generator design and optimize the design of a prototype turbine being built by a local energy company in this weekly seminar. Comfort with <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0716741741'>multivariable</a> and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393925161'>vector calculus</a> and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107013607'>basic electricity &amp; magnetism</a> is required for participation in <i>Magnetic Machines</i>.
