<p>The <a href='http://www.meetup.com/bostonQS/'>Boston Quantified Self Meetup</a> is a regular show-and-tell for people who are tracking data about their body and conducting personal investigations and research into their bodies, minds, and selves.  Exploring everything from the science of sleep to meditation's effects on the brain, everything is fair game.</p>
