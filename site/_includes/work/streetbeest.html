<p>More than four dozen volunteers came together over a couple months to design &amp; construct the streetbeest, <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/somesprouts/sets/72157625054741051/'>a twelve-foot tall, twenty-foot wide walking sculpture</a> inspired by the work of Dutch artist and engineer <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSKyHmjyrkA'>Theo Jansen</a>. This project was an experiment in collaboration, community-driven design, and an exploration of two, storied art forms: mechanical linkages &amp; parades. Months of work culminated in <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/somesprouts/sets/72157625056452497/'>a mile long march from Davis to Harvard Square</a> as part of the 2010 <a href="http://honkfest.org">HONK! Parade</a>.</p>
