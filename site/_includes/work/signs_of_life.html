<p>Signs of Life fuses philosophy, biology, and engineering, asking participants to explore what it means for something to be "alive" by making something which is alive in one way or another each session while working on their own, longer term project throughout the program. 
By physically and digitally prototyping artifacts which are alive&mdash;whether basic robots which respond to feedback or simulations incorporating evolutionary computation&mdash;participants work in media ranging from <a href='http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx'>LEGO Mindstorms</a> and <a href='http://scratch.mit.edu'>Scratch</a> to arts &amp; crafts supplies to <a href='http://processing.org/'>Processing</a> and <a href='http://www.arduino.cc/'>Arduino</a>.
