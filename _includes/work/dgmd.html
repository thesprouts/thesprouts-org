	This <a href="https://www.summer.harvard.edu/courses/creative-explorations-screen-based-physical-computing/33380">Harvard Extension School course</a> introduces computing as an expressive medium and has been run during Spring and Summer sessions over a number of years in collaboration with our board member Bakhtiar Mikhak. In it, we create interactive, computational stories, art, and games presented as web applications and physical prototypes. We use gift-giving as a way to think about user-centered design. We prototype, exhibit, and critique each other's work in an ongoing way throughout the course.
