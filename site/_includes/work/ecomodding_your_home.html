  Ecomodding Your Home is a two month seminar focused on identifying and implementing simple strategies to reduce electricity consumption.  Participants use a custom power strip developed at sprout which allows you to meter, monitor, and control electricity usage, bringing computation &amp; intelligence to everyday appliances&mdash;whether automatically turning off your TV's standby mode while you're at work or dimming your lamp when its sunny outside.
