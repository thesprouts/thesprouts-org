# README

This repository contains the source for [sprout & co's website](http://thesprouts.org).  If you're having trouble or have spotted an issue the site, please [let us know](mailto:three.two.one-contact@thesprouts.org).

## Overview

sprout's site is statically generated using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and served up via [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/).

### Developing on `thesprouts.org`

To get started working on sprout's site, I recommend you [set up rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/).  Once this is set up, you should be able to:

    git clone git@github.com:thesprouts/thesprouts.org.git
    cd thesprouts.org
    rackup -s thin

We recommend using [thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/) because of [a minor annoyance with WEBrick](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7082364/what-does-warn-could-not-determine-content-length-of-response-body-mean-and-h).
