	The 7th and 8th grades at <a href="http://www.somerville.k12.ma.us/schools/arthur-d-healey-school-pk-8">Somerville's Healey School</a> brought us on board to implement project-based STEAM curricula in their middle grades. During the 2016-17 school year, we worked with 7/8 staff to design, develop, and deploy 3 week long, project-based programs across their math, science, ELA, and social studies classes. Moving forward, we are continuing to work closely with staff to incorporate this type of work and approach into their regular classroom curricula in an ongoing way.
