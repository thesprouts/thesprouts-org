  Instrument design is an astounding mix of art, craft &amp; science&mdash;despite how much we know, we don't know much about why instruments sound the way they do. <i>Flutes &amp; Waves</i> is a workshop series aiming to get our hands dirty with how sound works.  With a professional flute maker from the <a href='http://wmshaynes.com/'>Haynes Flute Company</a> and a local mechanical engineer, participants make their own flutes and riff on their form, exploring how flutes' design controls their acoustics, and the nature of timbre and harmonics.
