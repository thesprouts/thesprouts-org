<p>Engineering the Wind is a program run independently at sprout and in partnership with MIT, led by two, professional wind engineers: Eric Smith and Ben Polito. Through it, participants design and build a personal scale wind turbine, splitting their time between exploring the physics of wind turbines and shop time putting those ideas into practice.</p>
