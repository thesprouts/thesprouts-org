	Working with the students of <a href="http://www.codmanacademy.org/">Codman Academy</a>'s HLI, we spent three weeks digging our hands into creating digital, interactice stories using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Starting with 1-3 panel comics with simple, interactive elements like changing colors and shapes, disappearing acts, and mouse-activated sounds, participants go on to create everything from stop motion animations to digital, graphic novels to adaptations of their favorite stories. By bringing together storytelling and computation, we are able to make computers do our bidding, bringing our ideas and words to life.
