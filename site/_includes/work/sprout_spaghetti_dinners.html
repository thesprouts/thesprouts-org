Inspired by the spaghetti dinners of <a href='http://www.greatsmallworks.org/'>Great Small Works</a>, this dinner theater series brings people together around good food, music, performance, and a monthly theme.  Looking to blur the line between art and academia, the series asks academics to approach their lectures as performance and puppeteers to cast their theater as pedagogy.  Each month, we bring together a community of investigators interested in informal, social learning around a program of presentations and performances which can help us understand the month's theme from a new perspective.
