  Over the past few years, we've been working with the City, school district, and other Somerville community members to start a new high school, an <a href="http://www.mass.gov/edu/innovation-schools.html">Innovation School</a>, extending the themes behind sprout's previous work: project-based learning, storytelling, computational thinking, and a deep integration with the community. We began this journey back in 2012, and we are still going strong, piloting some of our ideas at the Healey School, receiving a grant to support our ongoing work on this project from <a href="https://xqsuperschool.org/">The XQ Institute</a>, and continuing to work with SPS to move the project forward.
