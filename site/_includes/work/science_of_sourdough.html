  Since sprout began, we've been compelled by everyday laboratories which aren't really seen as laboratories.  Gardens are one.  Kitchens are another.  The <i>Science of Sourdough</i> is a series of drop-in workshops aimed at interweaving a love of cooking and an excitement about the chemistry in their kitchen, exploring the hows and whys of the basic processes and heuristics of baking.  No experience (in baking or chemistry) required.
