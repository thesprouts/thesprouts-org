  <i>Turtle Geometry</i> is one of sprout's longest-running projects.  Inspired by Abelson &amp; DiSessa's classic book, <a class='book' href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262510375'>Turtle Geometry</a>, the various incarnations of this seminar have explored&mdash;among other things&mdash;how computation can unlock simulation, differential geometry, topology, and art.  Participants range from six-year old children to math educators to college students to practicing artists &amp; engineers.  These groups work in environments like <a href='http://scratch.mit.edu'>Scratch</a>, <a href='http://processing.org'>Processing</a>, and <a href='http://nodebox.net/'>NodeBox</a>, and as part of this long-term endeavor we are also working to develop our own, LOGO-like Javascript environment called itch.js.
