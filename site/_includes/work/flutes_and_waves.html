  Instrument design is an astounding mix of art, craft &amp; science&mdash;despite how much we know, we don't know much about why great instruments sound the way they do. In this workshop, participants design and make their own flutes, exploring how flutes are manufacture, how their design controls their acoustics, and the nature of timbre and harmonics.
