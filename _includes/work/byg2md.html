  <i>Bring Your Grandma to Math Day</i> (BYG2MD)&mdash;hosted annually with the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/museum/">MIT Museum</a>&mdash;explores the playful mathematics behind board games, origami, geometric puzzles, and more.  It's a shame when parents &amp; grandparents "can't help [their kids] with the homework anymore."  BYG2MD's focus is on bringing multiple generations, families, &amp; neighborhoods together to explore mathematics <em>as mathematicians practice it</em>: playfully, through games, puzzles, &amp; creative projects.
