  Inspired by works like Braitenberg's <a class='book' href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262521121'>Vehicles</a> and Schr&ouml;dinger's <a class='book' href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107604664'>What is Life?</a>, sprout's <i>Signs of Life</i>, asks participants to explore what it means for something to be "alive."  We do this by prototyping projects which <em>are alive</em> (in one way or another)&mdash;whether that's <a href='http://makezine.com/images/02/mousy.pdf'>robots responsive to feedback</a> or <a href='http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/#chapter09_section10'>simulations incorporating evolutionary computation</a>.  Participants work with media ranging from <a href='http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx'> Mindstorms</a> and <a href='http://scratch.mit.edu'>Scratch</a> to arts &amp; crafts supplies to <a href='http://processing.org/'>Processing</a> and <a href='http://www.arduino.cc/'>Arduino</a> to bring their creations to life.
