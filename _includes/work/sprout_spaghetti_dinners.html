  Inspired by the community events of <a href='http://www.greatsmallworks.org/'>Great Small Works</a>, this dinner theater series brings people together around food, music, &amp; performance united by a monthly theme.  Seeking to blur the line between art and academia, the series asks academics to approach their lectures as performance and puppeteers to cast their theater as pedagogy.  Each month, we bring folks together around a program of presentations &amp; performances which at their best help us understand a piece of everyday life from a new perspective.
