  Parading, sculpture, and spectacle are among the oldest of community-driven collaborations and often involve impressive feats of design, engineering, and logistics. <i>Kinetic Arts &amp; Crafts</i> is a program run in partnership with the <a href="http://www.eliotschool.org/">Eliot School</a> hoping to capture a bit of that history and bring it to Boston area youth.  In it, participants combine kinetic sculpture &amp; float design over eight weeks, culminating in a sidewalk spectacle and parade through Jamaica Plain's downtown.
