<p>
  <a href='https://inbloom.org/'>inBloom</a>&#8217;s mission is to &#8220;inform &amp; involve each student &amp; teacher with data &amp; tools designed to <em>personalize</em> learning.&#8221; Focus on that word, &#8220;personalize.&#8221; At the moment, this is an exciting word for many people in education. In this crowd, there is a common distinction between &#8216;transmission&#8217; and &#8216;construction&#8217; as metaphors for teaching (construed as transmitting information) &amp; learning (construed as constructing a mental model).
</p>
<p>
  Framing teaching in terms of &#8216;transmission&#8217; makes it a problem of communication and information. You become naturally concerned with clarity and structure and prerequisites. Issues like classroom management or student engagement become constraints which buttress or obstruct the primary focus: communicating to students.
</p>
<p>
  Although this in fact is what typically happens in many classrooms, the party line of graduate schools of education and the broader world of educational theory is that transmission&#8217;s no good. So, you&#8217;ll often see teachers&#8217; email signatures cite Yeats&#8217; <a href="http://thinkexist.com/quotation/education_is_not_filling_a_bucket-but_lighting_a/15313.html">&#8220;Education is not filling a bucket, but lighting a fire.&#8221;</a> or Hutchins&#8217; <a href="http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the-objective-of-education-is-to-prepare-the/538254.html">&#8220;The objective of education is to prepare the young to educate themselves throughout their lives.&#8221;</a> before going back to a classroom where they stand at the front.
</p>
<p>
  Framing learning in terms of &#8220;construction&#8221; makes it a problem of giving students puzzles, projects, and experiences which develop their mental models. You become naturally concerned with engagement and epistemology and ideas&#8217; expressive power. Issues like curriculum or assessment become constraints which buttress or obstruct the primary focus: surfacing &amp; iterating learners&#8217; models.
</p>
<p>
  If this happens in classrooms, you&#8217;ll see it under the banner of &#8216;project-based learning&#8217; or &#8216;learning by doing&#8217; or &#8216;hands-on.&#8217; But as with any words, these can and have been corrupted and diluted, often to denote their precise opposite, for myriad reasons&mdash;most driven by the gap between our nominal values and our functional priorities for education.
</p>
<p>
  While progressive educators have reached nominal consensus that &#8216;construction&#8217; trumps &#8216;transmission,&#8217; that is not the point I&#8217;m trying to make. I just want to highlight the distinction these two, broad, rhetorical camps offer; I think it has a lot to teach us about personalization.
</p>
<p>
  But before considering personalization in education, it is instructive to look around and consider &#8216;personalization&#8217; in other domains. We should be suspicious any time we notice that classic trick of marketing something whose inverse is unimaginable&mdash;after all, who <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> want personalized education? If you cannot invert the reform and find something someone reasonable might disagree with, you have a platitude on your hands. And platitudes that front for reforms corrupt their language and often end up running defense for other, more obscure dynamics.

<h3 id="watch-tv-shows-movies-anytime-anywhere."><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Watch <span class="caps">TV</span> shows &amp; movies anytime, anywhere.&#8221;</h2>
<p>
  Netflix doesn&#8217;t talk much about personalization&mdash;they&#8217;ve had an incredibly consistent focus on becoming the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990117011532/http://www.netflix.com/">&#8220;best way to rent a movie&#8221;</a> since they began in 1999. Now, their value proposition is, <a href="http://netflix.com">&#8220;For one low monthly price, Netflix members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments.&#8221;</a> You have to dig around a bit to find mention of their ratings system, <a href="https://signup.netflix.com/MediaCenter/HowNetflixWorks">&#8220;It&#8217;s only Members can rate the movies and <span class="caps">TV</span> shows theyâ€™ve watched through their <span class="caps">TV</span> or on the Netflix website. Netflix takes these ratings and pairs them with billions of other ratings by other Netflix members to accurately predict movies and <span class="caps">TV</span> shows members will enjoy.&#8221;</a> This despite the fact that they famously hosted <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">a million-dollar competition</a> to improve the accuracy of their predictions.
</p>
<p>
  So, what problem is personalization solving for Netflix? Well Netflix wants people to watch more movies. Finding movies that people want to watch is a natural solution to this. Sometimes, people don&#8217;t know what they want to watch or what they&#8217;d like. So a matching algorithm helps them <em>find something customers want</em>.

<h3 id="happy-birthday"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Happy Birthday!&#8221;</h2>
<p>
  Imagine it&#8217;s your girlfriend&#8217;s birthday. You want to get her a gift. Do you get her a personalized gift? &#8220;Well, sure.&#8221; But you probably don&#8217;t use that language unless you&#8217;re monogramming or tailoring it. (Set those examples to the side; we&#8217;ll be seeing more like them.) We assume gifts are personalized unless they&#8217;re giveaway swag. How do you personalize your gift? Well, hopefully you know them well enough to simulate whether they&#8217;d like a given trinket. Sometimes we need help brainstorming trinkets, but rarely&mdash;at least with those girlfriends we know well&mdash;do we need help deciding whether they&#8217;ll like it. To brainstorm, you might browse their Pinterest or keep a list of things they want or head to their <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=social+wishlist&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=social+wishlist&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j0l3j62l2.2627j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">social wishlist</a>.
</p>
<p>
  So, what problem is this process of personalization solving for you? It&#8217;s helping you <em>find something they want</em>.

<h3 id='im-looking-for-someone'><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I&#8217;m looking for someone who can read my profile and write an intelligent message and isn&#8217;t a serial killer&#8221;</h2>
<p>
  Imagine you&#8217;re single. And 26. Most of your friends from college have moved on. You&#8217;ve just finished your graduate program and are quickly discovering you never actually learned how to make friends. Much less find a date. Luckily, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/">an app</a> for that. So you fill out your OKCupid profile, answer their hundred question personality test, and start browsing. When you use OKCupid&#8217;s <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/help/your-matches">special blend</a> or <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/help/quiver">Quiver</a> features, you&#8217;re getting personalized dating advice and matchmaking.
</p>
<p>
  But unlike our examples so far, it&#8217;s subtler than &#8220;helping you find what you want.&#8221; Sure, you can search for &#8220;single, straight, very attractive blond, measurements <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrBx6mAWYPU&amp;t=48s">36-24-36</a>, looking for casual sex in my area&#8221; but that&#8217;s not what OKCupid is <em>for</em>. In OKCupid, personalization is a mix of matching and satisfying you. OKCupid aspires to find <em>people you want</em> whom you have some better-than-average chance of <em>getting</em> who <em>also want you</em>.
</p>


<h3 id="does-this-make-me-look-fat"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Does this make me look fat?&#8221;</h2>
<p>
  Imagine you&#8217;re shopping for a shirt. You walk into the department store and an associate comes up to help you. At their best, you might say they&#8217;re working to &#8216;personalize&#8217; your shirt&mdash;helping you find one appropriate for a given occasion or one that&#8217;ll complement your wardrobe or accommodate your tummy. But there&#8217;s a big difference between the type of personalization something like <a href="http://www.blanklabel.com/">Blank Label</a> provides (tailored fit) and something like <a href="http://www.spreadshirt.com/custom-clothing-C3744">spreadshirt</a> provides (customized prints). Blank Label is <em>matching you</em>&mdash;i.e. personalization is helping you <em>find something appropriate for your body</em>. spreadshirt is matching <em>your desires</em>&mdash;i.e. personalization is <em>customization</em>. In both cases you &#8216;want&#8217; the shirt (and indeed, even Blank Label offers customization through choice of pattern and fabric), but in one case you&#8217;re asking someone to treat you and in the other to serve you. Keep this distinction in mind, we&#8217;ll come back to it.
</p>

<h3 id="im-ready-to-up-my-weight"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I&#8217;m ready to up my weight.&#8221;</h2>
<p>
  Imagine you walk into the gym with your weightlifting partner. You lie down on the bench, and they begin loading up your regular load&mdash;180lbs. But last time, your partner saw that you were having a pretty easy time of it. As he puts on the last 10lb weight he pauses to ask, &#8220;You want to bump up your weight? You seemed ready for it last time.&#8221; Now if the benchpress had automatically suggested this to you based on measuring your impedance and completion rate, you wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see the inevitable Valley startup&#8217;s page lead with, <em>Helping you personalize your weight training experience</em>. So what is your friend doing? It&#8217;s a little more complicated than our other examples. They&#8217;re helping you find a weight that&#8217;s appropriate for you (in this way they are personalizing things as Blank Label does), but there are a bunch of other functions they serve: e.g. egging you on. Unfortunately, these affective components of your experience don&#8217;t really have a rhetorical home in discussions of personalization. But [un]luckily for you, <a href="http://www.bogost.com/blog/gamification_is_bullshit.shtml">&#8220;gamification&#8221;</a> has got that covered.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, let&#8217;s return to education. What type of problem is personalization solving in education? I can&#8217;t speak for advocates of personalization or even its target audiences, but I see one, overarching theme tying together personalization efforts. If we look at what school does rather than what graduate schools of education say, we might model &#8216;education&#8217; as a process of exposing students to the right information at the right time and in the right order, &#8216;personalization&#8217; becomes the process of defining &#8216;right&#8217; and making the implementation of more correct answers scalable. Which <em>almost</em> sounds like our earlier analogies&#8217; mix of matching and satisfaction. Except there&#8217;s a tension when we look more closely at the structure of whose desires and constraints are being satisfied. And that tension points to the driving force behind personalization: its promise to render learners <em>legible</em>.
</p>

<h2 id="rendering-learners-legible">Rendering learners legible</h2>
<p>
  James <span class="caps">C.</span> Scott&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300078153"><em>Seeing Like a State</em></a> is one of my very favorite books. In it, Scott walks through half a dozen &#8220;schemes to improve the human condition&#8221; which have failed. Whether introducing permanent last names to lubricate tax collection or subdividing land into plots to support industrial agriculture or centralizing planning in high modernist cities like Brasilia to increase efficiency, Scott tells a compelling story about the pressure to render resources&mdash;human and natural&mdash;&#8220;legible.&#8221; Scott paints &#8220;legibility&#8221; as a primary force in the practice of statecraft specifically and modernism more broadly because of its role as precursor to control and value extraction. In doing so, Scott beautifully articulates a terrifying warning against the combination of institutional hubris and authoritarian structures. Planners of all stripes not only assume they understand the systems they tweak (whether natural or political) but that abstract, interchangeable elements comprise these systems (whether trees or citizens). The resulting design errors and ripples of unintended consequences become either the systems&#8217; undoing, or are seen as cause for even broader mandates to tweak and engineer systems, piling intervention atop intervention.
</p>
<p>
  These failures are tragedies in the purest sense. Not only do they originate in hubris, but they are motivated by optimistic and altruistic views of progress and humankind. Scott traces these tragic dimensions back to a common set of characteristics, many of which are germane to our investigation. Consider the following juxtapositions (here, I quote Scott directly): + <strong>&#8220;Another student, another user&#8221;</strong> :: &#8220;The lack of context and particularity is not an oversight; it is the necessary first premise of any large-scale planning exercise. To the degree that the subjects can be treated as standardized units, the power of resolution in the planning exercise is enhanced.&#8221;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>What&#8217;s missing is access to the right information at the right time&mdash;it&#8217;s all about information transmission&#8221;</strong> :: &#8220;The clarity of the high-modernist optic is due to its resolute singularity. Its simplifying fiction is that, for any activity or process that comes under its scrutiny, there is only one thing going on. In the scientific forest there is only commercial wood being grown; in the planned city there is only the efficient movement of goods and people; in the housing estate there is only the effective delivery of shelter, heat, sewage, and water; in the planned hospital there is only the swift provision of professional medical services.&#8221;
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>&#8216;Average&#8217; teachers &amp; students need our help&#8221;</strong> :: &#8220;What is perhaps most striking about high-modernist schemes, despite their quite genuine egalitarian and often socialist impulses, is how little confidence they repose in the skills, intelligence, and experience of ordinary people.&#8221;
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>If students are not doing what they should, we can make them&#8221;</strong> :: &#8220;If such schemes have typically taken their most destructive human and natural toll in the states of the former socialist bloc and in revolutionary Third World settings, that is surely because there authoritarian state power, unimpeded by representative institutions, could nullify resistance and push ahead.&#8221;
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Personalization will disrupt a broken industry&#8221;</strong> :: &#8220;[Reforms&#8217;] power, it is worth remembering, was least contested at those moments when other forms of coordination had failed or seemed utterly inadequate to the great tasks at hand: in times of war, revolution, economic collapse, or newly won independence.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Technology will unlock students&#8217; potential and provide great education to all&#8221;</strong> :: &#8220;That these tragedies could be so intimately associated with optimistic views of progress and rational order is in itself a reason for a searching diagnosis.&#8221;
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Some domains&mdash;like movie recommendations&mdash;are amenable to simplifying assumptions. The unarticulated reasons underlying this are many, but consider: the screen you need doesn&#8217;t change depending on the movie you show; all movies are files; most movies occupy similar roles in your day-to-day (i.e. they are a two hour endeavor in the evening); Netflix doesn&#8217;t need to care about why you want a movie to give it to you effectively; the list goes on.
</p>
<p>
  But many of these advantages can be summed up simply: movies and movie-watchers are <em>legible</em>. And while there&#8217;s a fascinating discussion to be had connecting the modernist efforts Scott explores with the internal structure &amp; logic of school, that&#8217;s not what I want to focus on. I want to highlight that each of these overlaps&mdash;abstraction, technoutopianism, information centricity, and so on&mdash;is deeply driven by or complicit in a need to render students legible in an effort to create a system at scale. And that need to create a system at scale is driven by our desire&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;to impose a will on students to fix &#8220;a social problem.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  Personalization accelerates and lubricates this process of rendering students legible. To see this unvarnished, we must examine the language of those advocating personalization. And in that language, if you listen for power dynamics you will find a very different landscape than what you heard in our earlier work exploring analogies to personalization. As you read these excerpts from <a href="https://inbloom.org/about-inbloom">inBloom</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/about">Khan Academy</a>, ask yourself what the analogous statements from the weight trainer or birthday buyer or Netflix executive would look like.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>With access to the right information, educators can gauge student performance, develop insights, and act quickly to help students achieve their goals&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Read that again. Whose are &#8216;their&#8217; goals?
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Coaches, parents, and teachers have unprecedented visibility into what their students are learning and doing on the Khan Academy.&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
  <p>
    Read that again. Given the option, how many students would naturally give well-meaning &#8220;Coaches, parents, and teachers&#8221; that visibility, if the choice were students&#8217;?
  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Every time you work on a problem or watch a video, the Khan Academy remembers what you&#8217;ve learned and where you&#8217;re spending your time. We keep all of this data private but expose powerful statistics to each user and their coaches. You get at-a-glance information about everything you&#8217;ve been learning and whether or not you&#8217;ve been hitting your goals.&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Read that again. For every minute a &#8220;coach&#8221; spends looking at that data, how many minutes do you think the average learner will spend&mdash;of their own volition&mdash;doing the same?
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>You&#8217;re joining millions of Khan Academy students from all over the world who learn at their own pace every single day.&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Read that again. Is the average student more or less excited to join the millions of Khan Academy students than the average &#8221;<em>coach</em>&#8221; is excited to join the thousands of Khan Academy coaches?
</p>

<p>
  Returning to our earlier examples of personalization&mdash;the weight trainer and birthday buyer and Netflix customer&mdash;what does it mean that there is no such tension in those examples? I think that&#8217;s quite significant. If you aren&#8217;t convinced, two more examples of personalization&mdash;if you&#8217;ll bear with me&mdash;will make that clear.
</p>

<h3 id='more-open-and-connected'><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>more open &amp; connected&#8221;</h2>
<p>
  Facebook&#8217;s mission is to make the world more open and connected. <a href="<span class="caps">TK</span>">85% of Facebook&#8217;s revenue</a> comes from advertising. Which means Facebook&#8217;s users are not its customers. And you can hear that tension in everything Facebook says and does. Even in Zuckerberg&#8217;s <a href="<span class="caps">TK</span>">letter to investors</a>, it takes a few paragraphs to get to the money shot: &gt; &#8220;As people share more, they have access to more opinions from the people they trust about the products and services they use. This makes it easier to discover the best products and improve the quality and efficiency of their lives. &gt; One result of making it easier to find better products is that businesses will be rewarded for building better products - ones that are personalized and designed around people. We have found that products that are &#8220;social by design&#8221; tend to be more engaging than their traditional counterparts, and we look forward to seeing more of the world&#8217;s products move in this direction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  Notice how sloppily Facebook slips between customers and users, between &#8216;being advertised to&#8217; and &#8216;keeping up with my friends,&#8217; between &#8216;providing product recommendations&#8217; and &#8216;making the world more open and connected.&#8217;
</p>

<h3 id='manage-your-attention-better'><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>manage your attention better&#8221;</h2>
<p>
  But Facebook is not alone. Googleâ€™s mission is &#8220;to organize the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful.&#8221; <a href="<span class="caps">TK</span>">96% of <em>their</em> revenue</a> comes from advertising. But you could be forgiven if you were to browse <a href="<span class="caps">TK</span>">their about page</a> and miss that. Which notably, begins with the rhetoric of personalization, &#8220;Larry Page, our co-founder and <span class="caps">CEO</span>, once described the &#8216;perfect search engine&#8217; as something that &#8216;understands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want.&#8217;

<p>
  The first hint that Google&#8217;s users are not its customers is buried a couple paragraphs down, &#8220;[Making it as easy as possible for you to find the information you need and get the things you need to do done] means showing you when your friends like an ad or a search result, so that you know it might be valuable.&#8221; In 2010, Bradley Horowitz, <span class="caps">VP</span> of Product Marketing at the time, described Google Buzz as &#8216;a Google approach to sharing&#8217; and a tool that will &#8216;help you manage your attention better.&#8217; The most generous possible interpretation is in fact, &#8220;Advertisers will hire us to help you manage your attention better.&#8221; Notice again the easy slippage between customers and users, between attention and ads, between helping and selling.
</p>

<p>
  Now, let&#8217;s return to inBloom: <em>&#8220;With access to the right information, educators can gauge student performance, develop insights, and act quickly to help students achieve their goals.&#8221;</em> Read that again. That glib slippage between the interests of students and teachers is central to the rhetorical trick pulled by &#8216;personalization.&#8217; It manifests as the conflation of teaching and learning, of learning and assessment, of process and product. The reason this slippage happens is simple: without it, Facebook, Google, and Khan Academy would need to admit that they are <em>extracting value from their users</em> by rendering them <em>legible</em> to other parties (i.e. advertisers, educators). This is the <em>fundamental</em> difference between Reed Hastings and Sal Khan. Netflix makes money when they deliver value to you. inBloom makes money when they deliver value to <em>state departments of education</em>, whose goal is not uncomplicated&mdash;at their best they want to help students, but the truer statement (and weaker claim) is that they want to <em>treat</em> them. inBloom helps them control and manage the treatment process.
</p>
<p>
  To control a process you must first observe it. And you must be able to intervene in it, capitalizing on your observations to nudge the system in your desired direction. Ultimately, this is the promise of legibility&mdash;-by watching what students do and how they do it at a fine enough grain, we will be able to carefully move them along <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/">our curriculum</a> (Latin for <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/curriculum">&#8220;race course&#8221;</a>), <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/exercisedashboardt">our ontology</a>.
</p>
<p>
  When you hear &#8220;personalization&#8221; (&#8220;I will help you find and do what <em>you</em> want&#8221;) turn into &#8220;self-paced&#8221; (&#8220;I will help you find and do what <em>I</em> want you to do, in my order, but don&#8217;t worry&mdash;at your own pace.&#8221;), what are we to think? Ford said, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=QwckAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=%22Any+customer+can+have+a+car+painted+any+colour+that+he+wants+so+long+as+it+is+black.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t7hgUcneCs6s0AGi14H4Ag&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Any%20customer%20can%20have%20a%20car%20painted%20any%20colour%20that%20he%20wants%20so%20long%20as%20it%20is%20black.%22&amp;f=false">&#8220;Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants so long as it is black.&#8221;</a> That homogenization increased the efficiency and scalability of his revolutionary manufacturing techniques. This is worth keeping in mind when we <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQc0Zu1K_F8">listen to Sal Khan</a>: &gt; &#8220;If I said, &#8216;personalized education&#8217; hundred years ago, well there&#8217;s private tutors, it&#8217;s gonna be very very expensive&#8230;And there <em>were</em> attempts, <a href="<span class="caps">TK</span>">the book</a> talks a lot about them, over the past hundred years, actually trying to do personalized education. [&hellip;] And they actually had very good results. I mean, these were peer-reviewed studies, very very good results, but it was just logistically hard to do. If you wanted to do self-paced education without computers you&#8217;d have to have these worksheets going around, the teachers would have to do all of this logistics and information management. What&#8217;s exciting now, the technology, it&#8217;s not there&mdash;and I&#8217;m very clear on this in the book&mdash;the virtual education, the software isn&#8217;t there to replace physical schools. It&#8217;s there to empower schools, so they can finally do <em>personalized</em> education, in a scalable way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  Maybe my dystopic visions of banks of students swiping at shoddy Android tablets running skinned versions of crappy, free courses authored by <a href='http://www2.ed.gov/programs/innovation/index.html'>i3</a>-driven content farms &#8216;collaborating&#8217; with Google via their <a href="https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/">Course Builder</a>, overseen not by teachers but by &#8220;classroom managers&#8221; whom the kids (who are inevitably mostly poor, black, and brown&mdash;their white, upper middle class counterparts get &#8216;personalized&#8217; education in the form of, well, people. i.e. teachers at the local progressive school) call &#8220;wardens&#8221; behind their back is just my phobias writ large on the arc of technological progress.

<p>
  &hellip;I really do hope I&#8217;m wrong. I hope this is all much simpler than I&#8217;m making it out to be. But if &#8220;personalized education&#8221; neither resembles traditional school nor learning in the real world, whose interests drive that divergence? What answers to that question would scare us? Excite us? The question, &#8220;Can personalized education work?&#8221; is much less important to me than, &#8220;Whom will be hurt how by the ways that personalized education will fail?&#8221; It is essential that reforms not simply &#8216;work&#8217; but be robust to all sorts of ways of <em>not</em> working. And frankly, I&#8217;m not sure that an honest Sal Khan would be comfortable taking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath">the Hippocratic Oath</a>, to commit to first do no harm, with which I will close, in excerpt:
  <blockquote>
    I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone. [&hellip;] I will preserve the purity of my life and my arts. [&hellip;] I will leave this operation [in which I am not expert] to be performed by practitioners, specialists in this art. [&hellip;] In every house where I come I will enter only for the good of my patients [&hellip;] If I keep this oath faithfully, may I enjoy my life and practice my art, respected by all humanity and in all times; but if I swerve from it or violate it, may the reverse be my life.

      For some school is a place and others it is a process.  For all, it is an institution. And institutions need rituals.  To most, these rituals seem the mechanics enabling school&#8217;s nominal goal: knowledge transfer.  But habits can define us, and perhaps the cumulative effects of our time&#8217;s texture are more important than how we use that time in the first place.

      <p>
  Every morning, I brush my teeth. &#8220;One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.&#8221; I brush in multiples of seven. I shift the toothbrush over one tooth. &#8220;One, two, three, four, five, six seven.&#8221; And I repeat. I do the same for the insides and tops of my teeth. &#8220;One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.&#8221; Then I spit and brush my tongue. &#8220;One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.&#8221; I take a gulp of water, swish seven times, and spit it out. Every morning.
</p>

<p>
  This is a habit. I formed it intentionally. While I&#8217;m brushing my teeth&mdash;despite the fact I keep count&mdash;my mind wanders&hellip;to my dreams, the day ahead, the day behind. This habit serves to <em>free</em> my attention; it lets me <em>focus</em> on other things while I brush my teeth.
</p>

<p>
  Every evening (except for Saturday), I draft a wilt. &#8220;wilt&#8221; stands for &#8220;what i learned today.&#8221; It&#8217;s an email with five bullet points. Three of those bullet points are observations about what I thought or learned that day. Two of them are wirts, i.e. &#8220;what i read today.&#8221; I send this email out to the same people, every day.
</p>

<p>
  This is a habit. I formed it intentionally. While I&#8217;m wilting, however, I am thinking about nothing else; I am processing my day and doing occasionally hard thinking to communicate a new idea. This habit serves to <em>focus</em> my attention; it lets me <em>ignore</em> other things while I write.
</p>

<p>
  I brush my teeth because the health of my teeth matters to me. I don&#8217;t want bad breath. I want to avoid dental bills. I want to avoid being having ugly teeth.
</p>

<p>
  I wilt because of certain ideas I have about my intellectual development. I want to actively reflect on my experience. I want to keep in touch with the small group with whom I wilt. I want to set up a structure encouraging me to read something meaty every day.
</p>

<p>
  Embedded in each of these habits is a set of values. By engaging in these habits, I privilege certain values. I am pushed to embrace those things which pay respect to those values&mdash;or even better, make these habits easier. &#8220;Cleanliness&#8221; or &#8220;intellectual rigor&#8221; or &#8220;easily documented&#8221; or &#8220;interesting to my friends&#8221; or &#8220;attractive to others&#8221;&mdash;each of these, with different weights and emphases, inform and are informed by my habits.
</p>

<p>
  The arrow of causation can go both ways&mdash;not only does each habit carry with it a utility, each habit can inculcate the value of that utility in us. Anyone who has gone to Mass or boot camp can attest to this.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, adopting a habit normalizes certain expectations about how you handle &#8220;that type of thing.&#8221; Personal hygiene is seen as a collection of small habits like brushing my teeth. Successful first dates, not so much. We think it&#8217;s reasonable that &#8216;staying healthy&#8217; require an hour a day of food and exercise considerations&mdash;even if most of us fall short of that. But, most wouldn&#8217;t think an hour a day of mental health care would be healthy unless it were reframed as something like meditation or family time.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;d like to suggest that we can bring this lens of &#8220;freeing&#8221; and &#8220;focusing&#8221; habits and the expectations they normalize to our experiences as students. Consider the average school day. And in particular, consider its schedule. Few think about patriotism during the Pledge of Allegiance. Few think about obedience when a teacher calls out, <a href="http://www.proteacher.net/discussions/showthread.php?t=510">&#8220;Give me five!&#8221;</a> Some think about algebra during algebra class.
</p>

<p>
  What about the schedule? What messages are embedded in the tempo of a buzzer every forty-seven minutes? Well, many&mdash;e.g. there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465097189">long history</a> of critique digging into the economic and sociological forces defining the institutional logic of a &#8216;period.&#8217; But actually, I&#8217;d like to set aside the various questions about what good learning looks like and what&#8217;s &#8220;necessary&#8221; to teach effectively in &#8220;today&#8217;s world.&#8221; I&#8217;d instead like to focus on a single, concrete side effect: the message we implicitly communicate about the nature of intellectual work. For at least eight years&mdash;just under nine thousand hours in school&mdash;the overwhelming majority of examples and experiences students have &#8216;learning something&#8217; suggest that &#8216;learning&#8217; happens in consistent, well-managed chunks of small, steady applications of effort to do something that someone else has laid out for you. This is the precise opposite of the deep work and focus that we know accompanies real learning.
</p>

<p>
  Again, at the moment I am not concerned with pedagogy&mdash;i.e. with what &#8216;effective teaching&#8217; looks like. Instead, I&#8217;d like to suggest a simple exercise: think through&mdash;minute by minute&mdash;a school day. (If you have a child of your own, even better&mdash;think through <em>their</em> day.) And don&#8217;t think about what the schedule <em>says</em> people do&mdash;i.e. don&#8217;t think, &#8220;Algebra class&#8221;&mdash;think about what you&#8217;d see if you could set up a videocamera and lay over the student&#8217;s thought-track for their day.
</p>

<p>
  Now when I run into a challenging question, my muscle memory tells me to &#8984;-tab to something easier. Sometimes it&#8217;s twitter, sometimes it&#8217;s my email, and most of the time I intercept the impulse. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;d see on my thought track (with a boring video of me staring at my computer, occasionally straightening my posture, and bobbing my head to a beat). These tiny vagaries give my time a texture. So be sure to think about that texture of each minute you imagine&mdash;is it spent deep in thought? Listening? Making something? Talking to someone? Thinking about a crush? Worrying about grades? Worrying about food?
</p>

<p>
  Imagine integrating that habit over time, day-in and day-out, for one thousand days (about how long we spend in 6-12th grade). And importantly, imagine that you <em>never</em> see any other examples of learning. &#8220;Sure, ice skaters and actors and cellists quit school to pursue their craft,&#8221; you think, &#8220;But a) they&#8217;re nuts, b) that&#8217;s like 0.1% of folks, and c) my parents would <em>never</em> go for that.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  Now, consider the following juxtapositions. And for each of these, ask yourself, &#8220;If I were to turn each of these into a habit, what would that feel like? What habits would I develop or need? Following directions? Being playful? Skimming? Working together? Thinking deeply? Do I spend thirty minutes on a page or thirty seconds?&#8221;

<p>
  And finally, if you aren&#8217;t tired of the exercise yet, let&#8217;s turn it around.  Choose a texture of time and activity you would be proud to see yourself (or your child) adopt as their own. Are they sitting in an overstuffed chair smoking a pipe considering Aristotle? Are they waking up at 4A every day to train for a marathon? Are they making sure to get home by 6P every day so they can spend some quality time with <em>their</em> child? Look at their day to day experiences now and consider how (or whether) there&#8217;s any connection at all.
</p>

<p>
  The rhetoric of school centers on of &#8216;preparation.&#8217; Students are immersed in prerequisites for future courses, many of which are unknown. Their participation in classes are themselves an act of preparation for more classes in college or for the workforce. Because cooking dinner is different than eating dinner, it is simple to conclude that <em>preparing</em> for a rich intellectual life should look and feel different than <em>living</em> a rich, intellectual life. But cooking and living are not the same.  And just as spending too much time planning your kids&#8217; activities can change your relationship to them, we should not forget that these habits of preparation do not spin along in a vacuum&mdash;they change us. And that means we should have some very persuasive stories lined up which we can honestly deploy every forty-seven minutes, after each buzzer.

      Most schools look and feel the same, and not because of long evolution under the pressures of &#8216;student-centered design.&#8217;  If biodiversity helps Nature find clever solutions, can it help those of us interested in the future of learning?

      <p>
  Biodiversity helps evolution find new, better solutions faster. And evolution is especially good at finding solutions to multidimensional problems which haven&#8217;t proven susceptible to analysis. &quot;Education&quot; is one of these. Unfortunately, biodiversity is not a priority among reformers. Funding patterns and the hype cycle, among other influences, insure most focus on The Next Big Thing.
</p>

<p>
  In evolution, reproduction is what matters. So what&#8217;s the analogue of &#8216;reproductive success&#8217; for education? Answering that involves an essential discussion about the values and goals of education which I am going to sidestep entirely. Instead, I&#8217;m going to talk about something that&mdash;within our analogy&mdash;is more like &#8216;running fast.&#8217; That is, I want to talk about an activity which we would all agree is adaptive and which we should all hope our educational systems are getting better at nurturing: knowledge work.
</p>

<p>
  In 1957, Peter Drucker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1560006226">wrote</a> (<strong>emphasis</strong> mine):
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      In the United States, where most of the young people in the metropolitan areas go at least to high school, the assembly line is already obsolete. The labor necessary to run it is becoming scarce. Young people with a high school education do not want to work as human machine tools. [â€¦] How new these expectations are is shown in the field of personnel management. Only forty years old-it began in World War I&mdash;the discipline is already outdated in its concepts and its assumptions. Its principles, its rules, its practices and procedures all represent a distillation of experience with unskilled or semiskilled machine workers, largely from the metalworking industries. <strong>Today the majority of the personnel employed even in manufacturing industries are no longer of this kind, are rather people doing knowledge work</strong>, however unskilled. How far our personnel management theories really applied even to yesterday&#8217;s machine workers is an open question. For managing tomorrow&#8217;s employees, the products of the educated society, they are likely to be quite inadequate.
    </p>

<p>
  &quot;Knowledge work&quot; is work whose main capital is not physical output or labor, but &#8216;knowledge&#8217;, broadly construed. &quot;Knowledge workers&quot; are people who think for a living, and they dominate our economy. Think technologists and engineers and designers and executives. At its best, school is&mdash;quite literally&mdash;filled with &#8216;knowledge work.&#8217; So why do the org charts of tech companies and schools look so different?

But our democratic conscience would not brook the same inequality in our educational system. And a white, tech guy in his thirties is not a poor, brown girl in her teens. Differences abound. Regardless&mdash;if we believe school supports knowledge work&mdash;we should be able to simultaneously acknowledge those differences and explain <em>why</em> school looks and feels the way it does.
</p>

<p>
  There will always be constraints like equity. But saying our educational system will be &#8220;equitable&#8221; tells us no more about how it will look and feel than telling your girlfriend your new haircut&#8217;s &#8220;not too short.&#8221; If we are to design an educational system to support knowledge work, it might make sense to begin with the simple question, &quot;What is knowledge work like?&quot;
</p>

<p>
  Knowledge work is rarely about <em>process</em>. Knowledge work is characterized by the <em>absence</em> of routine&hellip;by a need for changing ratios of creative, convergent, &amp; divergent thinking&hellip;by a combination of working alone and together&hellip;by a <em>resistance</em> to quantitative metrics&hellip;by a focus on brainstorming and iteration and revisionâ€¦above all, by open-ended questions and uncertainty and risk.
</p>

<p>
  So how does the tech sector&mdash;an epitome of knowledge work&mdash;handle this?
</p>

<p>
  The basic answer is that we are still figuring that out. While there are clearly some themes in how these tech companies support and manage their employees&mdash;an emphasis on intrinsic motivation, flexible work schedules, a focus on small teams and rapid iteration, and so on&mdash;there is still tremendous diversity and turnover in management thinking here. Plenty has been written about the variety and novelty of management structures and philosophies that the past thirty years of high tech industry have created. But I think there&#8217;s an even more important, easy-to-agree upon, meta-lesson here: that diversity is <em>healthy</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Cornet&#8217;s orgchart cartoon is mostly tongue-in-cheek. But every technologist or employee at one of these companies will recognize the kernels of truth in the lampoon. And even simply among the six heavy-hitters you see enormous differences. And that is regarded as <em>healthy</em>&mdash;at no stockholders&#8217; meeting would you hear the claim that there&#8217;s A Universal Org Chart. Minimally, the claim is that collectively, the <em>biodiversity</em> of management structures, product strategy, company culture and so on contribute to a healthy organic process evolving more effective companies.
</p>

<p>
  So what about high schools? How do they accommodate knowledge work?
</p>

<p>
  Well, despite being a much larger, older institution than multinational tech companies with much less control over the problems they&#8217;re tasked with solving&mdash;high schools have basically homogeneous org charts. Of course, these org charts don&#8217;t necessarily reflect reality. And many of them are legally mandated, in one form or another. I don&#8217;t know what the &#8216;right&#8217; org chart is&mdash;if there even is such a thing. But I <em>do</em> know that it&#8217;s important for those of us interested in new models of learning to be able to tell a story about <em>why</em> the space of solutions we&#8217;ve explored looks the way it does so far. And more importantly, why do most schools look and feel the same?
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, if that story doesn&#8217;t tie back to claims about how people learn or what school is for, then perhaps there&#8217;s a new type of reform work to be done. Perhaps there are ways we can change the <em>types</em> of conversations we have instead of simply trumpeting a new message more loudly. This is no simple task. There are many boundary conditions that define the look and feel of school which implicitly define how we talk about school. I&#8217;m going to scratch the surface of just one: the schedule.
</p>

<div class='img' style='width: 770px; height: 599px; background: url("/img/blog/school_timetable.png")'>
<div class='caption'><a href='http://www.edline.net/pages/flhs'>Fairfield Ludlowe High School</a>&#8217;s timetable, via <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_timetable'>Wikipedia</a>.</div>
</div>

<p>
  Knowledge work often requires large, contiguous blocks of time to grapple with open-ended issues and uncertainty. It is trite to complain about the schedule cuts up students&#8217; and teachers&#8217; days. It is trivial to point to burgeoning literature on optimal conditions for learning and productivity and decry the school bell. But <em>why</em> does the schedule look like it does? There are many explanations for this&mdash;<em>e.g.</em> it mimics the factory floor schedule, it is a necessary consequence of &#8216;covering the curriculum,&#8217; and so on. I&#8217;d suggest that all of these reasons stem from exactly two needs: the need for [evidence of] <em>controllability</em> and the need for [evidence of] <em>observability</em>.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;ve lifted these terms from the field of control theory (or simply &#8216;controls&#8217;): a branch of mathematics and engineering that helps us design dynamic systems we can control and regulate. It&#8217;s responsible for your cruise control, your thermostat, and making sure the robotic arms that assemble your car don&#8217;t overshoot when they&#8217;re placing the passenger door. &quot;Controllability&quot; and &quot;observability&quot; are two of the fundamental aspects of a system with which controls engineers concern themselves when looking at a new problem.
</p>

<p>
  &quot;Controllability&quot; refers to our ability to move a system from one state into another (given certain constraints, like power density or efficiency). So if we were talking about your car&#8217;s cruise control, some can cars can get from zero to sixty miles per hour in six seconds, some in three. A Corvette&#8217;s cruise control looks different than a Beetle&#8217;s. &quot;Observability&quot; refers to our ability to look into a system and know what&#8217;s going on, to <em>find out</em> we&#8217;re going fifty so that the cruise control can decide what to do with our gas pedal. So in this cruise control analogy, what&#8217;s school&#8217;s &#8216;speed?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
  Well, <em>curriculum</em> is <a href='http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=curriculum&allowed_in_frame=0'>Latin for race course</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Schools are tasked&mdash;minimally&mdash;with implementing a <em>curriculum</em>. A curriculum is made up of <em>facts</em> and <em>skills</em>. The school&#8217;s job (pedagogically speaking) is to inculcate these facts and skills into students. But remember, schools are governed and managed at scale. So we must acknowledge that school&#8217;s job often reduces to <em>documenting</em> the performance of the curriculum. There are exactly two ways to do this. We can point to the inputs to school and take schooling&#8217;s efficacy on faith. Or, we can point to the outputs of school and take your measurement&#8217;s accuracy on faith. Of course, schools do a combination of these, documenting seat time or credits (inputs) <em>and</em> test scores or <span class="caps">GPA</span> (outputs).
</p>

<p>
  Even when we transcend questions of academic development, the boundary conditions of the conversation around what school looks and feels like is remarkably constant.  Consider a recent (heartbreaking) <a href='http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/487/harper-high-school-part-one'>pair of episodes</a> of <a href='http://www.thisamericanlife.org/'><i>This American Life</i></a> exploring <a href='http://www.harperhighschool.org/'>Harper High School</a> on the South Side of Chicago.  In particular, the episodes explore the deeply destructive effects of gun violence and modern gang culture on youth, staff, and the community at large.  Listening to it, it&#8217;s hard to understand why &#8216;school&#8217; is even in the picture; what you hear sounds more like a refugee camp or shelter for battered folks than an educational institution.  Yet, in discussing the importance of the <a href='http://www.isbe.net/apl/pdf/ipz/proposals/cps_turnaround_lead.pdf'>turnaround funds</a> the state had provided to Harper High School, the entirety of the focus is on the inputs to the system.  What follows is an excerpt from the episode wherein the principal discusses the effect of the turnaround funds on their efforts.  I&#8217;ve <em>highlighted</em> every effect mentioned.
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      One former district official involved in Harper&#8217;s turnaround told me that Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who used to run Chicago&#8217;s schools, he said to his former colleagues, with these new turnaround initiatives, like the one at Harper, he wanted to, quote, &#8220;take the issue of money off the table,&#8221; in other words, give them whatever they need. So the plan was pretty much boost the school with a lot of federal, state, and city money, then as the changes took hold, slowly ramp down the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then five years later, the funding would go back to normal. That&#8217;s next year. Next year is when the money goes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fall, I sat down with Principal Sanders and the school&#8217;s operations manager to talk about all this. They told me the money has done so much. There&#8217;s a new <em>culinary learning room</em>, new <em>computer equipment</em>, small stuff like a <em>new <span class="caps">ID</span> machine</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Principal Sanders talks about the first year of turnaround like it was amazing. There were <em>four assistant principals</em>, <em>reduced class sizes</em>. There was the kind of support staf&mdash;social workers and counselors&mdash;in numbers that other schools only dream of.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  This is the entirety of the discussion of the aggregate efficacy of the turnaround program.  I do not mean to critique Harper High or even question the efficacy of the interventions Principal Sanders lauds.  Not only do I have nothing against new computer equipment, but I even suspect it helped!  I do, however, mean to highlight the <i>rhetoric</i> that dominates the conversation.  For some set of folks&mdash;certainly for the elite, upper middle class folks that flow through <i>Teach for America</i> whose ilk will dominate policy and decisionmaking circles&mdash;<i>This American Life</i> is a reasonable place to look for the mainstream conversation.  This focus on inputs would make sense under a constant theory of change.  <i>e.g.</i> if the Red Cross talks about how useful bandages and bottled water and doctors are, we don&#8217;t balk because we have a deeply held (and widely corroborated) model of what &#8216;disaster relief&#8217; looks like.  As such, when we doubt institutions like the Red Cross, we doubt their stewardship, management, and efficiency&mdash;not their strategy.
</p>
<p>
  Yet, just a few minutes earlier in the program, a social worker at Harper confesses that it doesn&#8217;t seem like anything has changed in the past twenty years:
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Alex Kotlowitz</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crystal&#8217;s been working towards a second master&#8217;s degree, and in one of her classes this year has been reading a book I wrote over 20 years ago called <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385265565'><i>There Are No Children Here</i></a>, where I follow two brothers living in the projects on Chicago&#8217;s West Side. For a couple of years, I followed the boys as they grappled with violence, poverty, and the gangs. And Crystal wonders if reading it isn&#8217;t adding to her stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Crystal Smith</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was really interesting, though. To think that 20 years later, nothing has changed, that&#8217;s the scarier part.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  This feeling of stasis makes the focus on inputs all the more striking.
</p>

<p>
  Let&#8217;s set aside any doubts about either the efficacy of our methods or measurements and take a moment to notice how the system of grade levels, curricula, grades, class periods, and credits make it extraordinarily easy to <em>document</em> our inputs and outputs. If you had a pile of skills and facts that you had to disburse at a certain rate in a certain order and document that process, you can see how easily we might make an argument for the current schedule structure. This also gives us some insight into the enthusiasm with which &#8216;flipping the classroom&#8217; and &#8216;data-driven education&#8217; and &#8216;personalized learning&#8217; have been taken up by education reformers. Each of these efforts&mdash;in their own way&mdash;renders the learning process legible while simultaneously making the management of schooling easier. There&#8217;s very little tying any of these structures&mdash;including the traditional class schedule&mdash;to the needs of learners. There is a great deal tying these structures to the needs of the school.
</p>

<p>
  And so now we have plenty of reform wherein the party line&mdash;say, &quot;Learning happens through curricula which are broadcast through classes&quot;&mdash;is never articulated, but assumed. Then, vigorous debate and innovation and incubation are encouraged <em>within</em> those boundaries. And perhaps, more than Another Big Thing, we simply need a lot more space to grow some Small Things that needn&#8217;t satisfy those boundary conditions, <em>a priori</em>.
</p>

<p>
  I will finish with <a href="http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/david-foster-wallace-in-his-own-words?page=full">David Foster Wallace</a>,
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says &quot;Morning, boys. How&#8217;s the water?&quot; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes &quot;What the hell is water?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a standard requirement of <span class="caps">US</span> commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. This story turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you&#8217;re worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don&#8217;t be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.
