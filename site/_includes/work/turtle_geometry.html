<p>Turtle Geometry is one of sprout's longest-running program series.  Inspired by Abelson &amp; DiSessa's classic, <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Geometry-Mathematics-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0262510375/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1355503216&sr=1-1&keywords=turtle+geometry'><i>Turtle Geometry</i></a>, the various incarnations of this seminar explore how computation can unlock simulation, differential geometry, topology, and art.  Participants range from young children to math educators to college students to practicing artists and engineers.</p>
