<p>Mathful Play is a program run independently in Somerville and Cambridge, with homeschooling coops, and as part of the Somerville Public Schools afterschool program. By digging into real mathematics as found in games and puzzles, this program encourages participants to develop their own intuitions on everything from graph theory to topology by engaging the mathematics head-on and hands-on.</p>
