Biodiversity helps evolution find new, better solutions faster. And evolution is especially good at finding solutions to multidimensional problems which haven&#8217;t proven susceptible to analysis. &quot;Education&quot; is one of these. Unfortunately, biodiversity is not a priority among reformers. Funding patterns and the hype cycle, among other influences, insure most focus on The Next Big Thing.
</p>

<p>I
  n evolution, reproduction is what matters. So what&#8217;s the analogue of &#8216;reproductive success&#8217; for education? Answering that involves an essential discussion about the values and goals of education which I am going to sidestep entirely. Instead, I&#8217;m going to talk about something that&mdash;within our analogy&mdash;is more like &#8216;running fast.&#8217; That is, I want to talk about an activity which we would all agree is adaptive and which we should all hope our educational systems are getting better at nurturing: knowledge work.
</p>

<p>
  In 1957, Peter Drucker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1560006226">wrote</a> (<strong>emphasis</strong> mine):
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      In the United States, where most of the young people in the metropolitan areas go at least to high school, the assembly line is already obsolete. The labor necessary to run it is becoming scarce. Young people with a high school education do not want to work as human machine tools. […] How new these expectations are is shown in the field of personnel management. Only forty years old-it began in World War I&mdash;the discipline is already outdated in its concepts and its assumptions. Its principles, its rules, its practices and procedures all represent a distillation of experience with unskilled or semiskilled machine workers, largely from the metalworking industries. <strong>Today the majority of the personnel employed even in manufacturing industries are no longer of this kind, are rather people doing knowledge work</strong>, however unskilled. How far our personnel management theories really applied even to yesterday&#8217;s machine workers is an open question. For managing tomorrow&#8217;s employees, the products of the educated society, they are likely to be quite inadequate.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  &quot;Knowledge work&quot; is work whose main capital is not physical output or labor, but &#8216;knowledge&#8217;, broadly construed. &quot;Knowledge workers&quot; are people who think for a living, and they dominate our economy. Think technologists and engineers and designers and executives. At its best, school is&mdash;quite literally&mdash;filled with &#8216;knowledge work.&#8217; So why do Fig# and Fig# look so different?
</p>

</div>

<p>
  More to the point, why do Google and high school <em>feel</em> so different? Well, Silicon Valley is not the Department of Education. It&#8217;s <span class="caps">OK</span> if the #1 tech company is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(AAPL+profit)%2F(AAPL+operating+expenses)%2F((GOOG+profit)%2F(GOOG+operating+expenses))">five times more profitable than its nearest competitor</a>. But our democratic conscience would not brook the same inequality in our educational system. And a white, tech guy in his thirties is not a poor, brown girl in her teens. Differences abound. Regardless&mdash;if we believe school supports knowledge work&mdash;we should be able to simultaneously acknowledge those differences and explain <em>why</em> school looks and feels the way it does.
</p>

<p>
  There will always be constraints like equity. But saying our educational system will be &#8216;equitable&#8217; tells us no more about how it will look and feel than telling your girlfriend your new haircut&#8217;s &#8216;not too short.&#8217; If we are to design an educational system to support knowledge work, it might make sense to begin with the simple question, &quot;What is knowledge work like?&quot;
</p>

<p>
  Knowledge work is rarely about <em>process</em>. Knowledge work is characterized by the <em>absence</em> of routine…by a need for changing ratios of creative, convergent, &amp; divergent thinking…by a combination of working alone and together…by a <em>resistance</em> to quantitative metrics…by a focus on brainstorming and iteration and revision…above all, by open-ended questions and uncertainty and risk.
</p>

<p>
  So how does the tech sector&mdash;an epitome of knowledge work&mdash;handle this?
</p>

<p>
  The basic answer is that we are still figuring that out. While there are clearly some themes in how these tech companies support and manage their employees&mdash;an emphasis on intrinsic motivation, flexible work schedules, a focus on small teams and rapid iteration, and so on&mdash;there is still tremendous diversity and turnover in management thinking here. Plenty has been written about the variety and novelty of management structures and philosophies that the past thirty years of high tech industry have created. But I think there&#8217;s an even more important, easy-to-agree upon, meta-lesson here: that diversity is <em>healthy</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Fig# is mostly tongue-in-cheek. But every technologist or employee at one of these companies will recognize the kernels of truth in the lampoon. And even simply among the six heavy-hitters you see enormous differences. And that is regarded as <em>healthy</em>&mdash;at no stockholders&#8217; meeting would you hear the claim that there&#8217;s A Universal Org Chart. Minimally, the claim is that collectively, the <em>biodiversity</em> of management structures, product strategy, company culture and so on contribute to a healthy organic process evolving more effective companies.
</p>

<p>
  So what about high schools? How do they accommodate knowledge work?
</p>

<p>Well, despite being a much larger, older institution than multinational tech companies with much less control over the problems they&#8217;re tasked with solving&mdash;high schools have basically homogeneous org charts. Of course, these org charts don&#8217;t necessarily reflect reality. And many of them are legally mandated, in one form or another. I don&#8217;t know what the &#8216;right&#8217; org chart is&mdash;if there even is such a thing. But I <em>do</em> know that it&#8217;s important for those of us interested in new models of learning to be able to tell a story about <em>why</em> the space of solutions we&#8217;ve explored looks the way it does so far. And more importantly, why do most schools look and feel the same?
</p>

<p>Ultimately, if that story doesn&#8217;t tie back to claims about how people learn or what school is for, then perhaps there&#8217;s a new type of reform work to be done. Perhaps there are ways we can change the <em>types</em> of conversations we have instead of simply trumpeting a new message more loudly. This is no simple task. There are many boundary conditions that define the look and feel of school which implicitly define how we talk about school. I&#8217;m going to scratch the surface of just one: the schedule.
</p>

<div class='img' style='background: url("/img/blog/school_timetable.png")'>
<div class='caption'><a href='http://www.edline.net/pages/flhs'>Fairfield Ludlowe High School</a>&#8217;s timetable, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_timetable'>Wikipedia</a>.</div>
</div>

<p>
  Knowledge work often requires large, contiguous blocks of time to grapple with open-ended issues and uncertainty. It is trite to complain about the schedule cuts up students&#8217; and teachers&#8217; days. It is trivial to point to burgeoning literature on optimal conditions for learning and productivity and decry the school bell. But <em>why</em> does the schedule look like it does? There are many explanations for this&mdash;<em>e.g.</em> it mimics the factory floor schedule, it is a necessary consequence of &#8216;covering the curriculum,&#8217; and so on. I&#8217;d suggest that all of these reasons stem from exactly two needs: the need for [evidence of] <em>controllability</em> and the need for [evidence of] <em>observability</em>.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;ve lifted these terms from the field of control theory (or simply &#8216;controls&#8217;): a branch of mathematics and engineering that helps us design dynamic systems we can control and regulate. It&#8217;s responsible for your cruise control, your thermostat, and making sure the robotic arms that assemble your car don&#8217;t overshoot when they&#8217;re placing the passenger door. &quot;Controllability&quot; and &quot;observability&quot; are two of the fundamental aspects of a system with which controls engineers concern themselves when looking at a new problem.
</p>

<p>
  &quot;Controllability&quot; refers to our ability to move a system from one state into another (given certain constraints, like power density or efficiency). So if we were talking about your car&#8217;s cruise control, some can cars can get from zero to sixty miles per hour in six seconds, some in three. A Corvette&#8217;s cruise control looks different than a Beetle&#8217;s. &quot;Observability&quot; refers to our ability to look into a system and know what&#8217;s going on, to <em>find out</em> we&#8217;re going fifty so that the cruise control can decide what to do with our gas pedal. So in this cruise control analogy, what&#8217;s school&#8217;s &#8216;speed?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
  Well, <em>curriculum</em> is Latin for race course.
</p>

<p>
  Schools are tasked&mdash;minimally&mdash;with implementing a <em>curriculum</em>. A curriculum is made up of <em>facts</em> and <em>skills</em>. The school&#8217;s job (pedagogically speaking) is to inculcate these facts and skills into students. But remember, schools are governed and managed at scale. So we must acknowledge that school&#8217;s job often reduces to <em>documenting</em> the performance of the curriculum. There are exactly two ways to do this. We can point to the inputs to school and take schooling&#8217;s efficacy on faith. Or, we can point to the outputs of school and take your measurement&#8217;s accuracy on faith. Of course, schools do a combination of these, documenting seat time or credits (inputs) <em>and</em> test scores or <span class="caps">GPA</span> (outputs).
</p>

<p>
  Let&#8217;s set aside any doubts about either the efficacy of our methods or measurements and take a moment to notice how the system of grade levels, curricula, grades, class periods, and credits make it extraordinarily easy to <em>document</em> our inputs and outputs. If you had a pile of skills and facts that you had to disburse at a certain rate in a certain order and document that process, you can see how easily we might make an argument for the current schedule structure. This also gives us some insight into the enthusiasm with which &#8216;flipping the classroom&#8217; and &#8216;data-driven education&#8217; and &#8216;personalized learning&#8217; have been taken up by education reformers. Each of these efforts&mdash;in their own way&mdash;renders the learning process legible while simultaneously making the management of schooling easier. There&#8217;s very little tying any of these structures&mdash;including the traditional class schedule&mdash;to the needs of learners. There is a great deal tying these structures to the needs of the school.
</p>

<p>
  And so now we have plenty of reform wherein the party line&mdash;say, &quot;Learning happens through curricula which are broadcast through classes&quot;&mdash;is never articulated, but assumed. Then, vigorous debate and innovation and incubation are encouraged <em>within</em> those boundaries. And perhaps, more than Another Big Thing, we simply need a lot more space to grow some Small Things that needn&#8217;t satisfy those boundary conditions, <em>a priori</em>.
</p>

<p>
  I will finish with <a href="http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/david-foster-wallace-in-his-own-words?page=full">David Foster Wallace</a>,
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says &quot;Morning, boys. How&#8217;s the water?&quot; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes &quot;What the hell is water?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a standard requirement of <span class="caps">US</span> commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. This story turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you&#8217;re worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don&#8217;t be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.

      An overweening preoccupation with tools is the mark of an amateur.  The notion of a &#8220;best tool&#8221; inevitably producing &#8220;good work&#8221; is a distraction at best.  And in some, amateurish corners of programming culture, it&#8217;s a real obstacle to good learning.

  Too often, school reframes learning as skill- and fact-acquisiton.  At best this creates a blindspot to the various metacognitive dispositions and disciplines which define good learning.  At worst, it leaves learners predisposed to externalize all difficulties (&#8220;My teacher sucked.&#8221;) or internalize all difficulties solely in the language of skills (&#8220;I never was a math person.&#8221;)  Both leave the learner disabled.  Despite the fact that school has mostly failed to integrate computation into its world, in the course of our work we stub our toe on the projection of students&#8217; notions of &#8216;how learning works&#8217; all the time.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But I heard C++ was the best programming language!&quot; he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  And it is <em>always</em> a he. Typically, he hasn&#8217;t really ever <em>made</em> anything with computers, yet. And often, he doesn&#8217;t even know know anyone who has.  Although, his dad usually works in some sort of technical-cum-corporate role&hellip;maybe as a <span class="caps">CIO</span> or <span class="caps">CTO</span> or computer science professor.  Importantly, it&#8217;s rare that his father has written a real piece of code in years.  Regardless, this guy has made sure that his son grows up conflating &#8216;hard&#8217; &amp; &#8216;good.&#8217; The honest oversimplification, &quot;Some use C++ when optimizing performance,&quot; seals the deal. <em>This</em> ten year old, this aspiring software engineer, is going to learn to program in C++, because those things which are fast and hard and somewhat brutal are good (or at least, they&#8217;re for boys, and they&#8217;re certainly for <em>this</em> boy).
</p>

<p>
  Needless to say, he hasn&#8217;t found his way <em>into</em> programming, yet. Perhaps he&#8217;s downloaded <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> because he read a review that said it was a big deal in game development. Or maybe he persuaded his dad to buy him Microsoft Visual Studio for Christmas and spent the morning installing the 10GB <span class="caps">IDE.</span> And maybe he even got &quot;Hello World!&quot; out of the deal.  But for the most part, he&#8217;s a consumer&mdash;like the rest of us&mdash;though perhaps a little more assiduous a consumer of computer <em>culture</em>, too.
</p>

<p>
  But despite all of this, computers are <em>hugely</em> important in his world. He&#8217;s grown up around them. He sees them at the center of culture near (in video games, which also matter deeply to him) and far (in the Pixar films or Facebook <span class="caps">IPO</span> on <span class="caps">CNN</span> he sees with his family). That is, he has fallen in love with <em>the idea of computers</em>. Unfortunately, actual computer culture offers pretty slim pickings [for kids]&mdash;even nowadays. And so now, after a few years of modding his computer case and finagling <a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/">Maximum <span class="caps">PC</span></a> from his mom when they go to the grocery store and competitively reciting features &amp; acronyms from Apple&#8217;s latest product release, he&#8217;s ended up in a room with me and a handful of other kids. And we&#8217;re making stuff, on computers. Sometimes its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262510375">art</a>, sometimes its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262510375">math</a>&mdash; Usually with <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">LOGO</a> or <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> or <a href="http://nodebox.net/">NodeBox</a>; it doesn&#8217;t really matter how.  And inevitably, in the face of difficulty, the complaint bubbles to the surface, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t working because [the tool] sucks.  Why can&#8217;t we use C++?  Isn&#8217;t that the best?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  If the kids are young enough, I&#8217;m a compelling enough character to persuade them that their search for &#8216;the best programming language&#8217; is meaningless. Sometimes I can pull out <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/steve-jobs-in-1994-the-rolling-stone-interview-20110117?print=true">Steve Jobs</a>, or if they&#8217;re really invested, <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">Pete Norvig</a> or <a href="http://paulgraham.com/langdes.html">Paul Graham</a>. But more often than not, it takes another kid&mdash;someone explicitly <em>not</em> technical, often a <em>she</em>&mdash;to deprogram this fixation. When <em>she</em> makes a more interesting game or solves a problem <em>he</em> struggled with or maybe just obviously complains less than him, something clicks. And at that moment, he&#8217;s in a very fragile place. His ego is vulnerable &amp; open. He can reject the situation&mdash;calling it &#8216;dumb&#8217; or &#8216;just for kids&#8217; or a &#8216;waste of time&#8217;&mdash;or he can embrace it.  And ultimately, that&#8217;s a big part of my job.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <a class='full-link' href='http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2008-02/msg00247.html'>
      A language is an interface between programmers and hardware, so it has social/psychological/pedagogical features which are just as important as its formal properties. If a language can&#8217;t be efficiently ported on regular hardware, it&#8217;s the language that sucks, not the hardware. Similarly, if it doesn&#8217;t interface properly with its communities of coders (fails to build up standard coding practices, good libraries, trust&hellip;), the language sucks, not the people. Ergo Lisp sucks. Many Lisp zealots dismiss the language&#8217;s failures as &quot;merely social&quot;, but that&#8217;s missing the purpose of a language entirely: failing socially is just as bad as failing technically.

<p>
  So ultimately, computer languages are tools.  Meaning the cultural barriers to entry surrounding those tools matter just as much as the affordances the tools themselves provide.  And it is amidst the ramifications of this fact that most of the interesting and important work expanding our computational fluency is to be done.  Take video games.  Video games are incredibly prominent in the world of children (<em>i.e.</em> boys).  This has meant that video games have become a real entry point to computation for many [boys].
</p>
<p>
  We should not be looking to &#8216;bring [the poor, the brown, the female] to computation.&#8217;  We should be bring computation to the ideas and problems and cultures which matter <em>to them</em>. Seymour Papert was trumpeting this idea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465046746">in 1980</a>.  Writing about Brazil&#8217;s <em>samba schools</em>[community dancehalls where dancing is a community practice]:
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      There are problems with the image of samba schools as the locus of education. I am sure that a computational samba school will catch on somewhere. But the first one will almost certainly happen in a community of a particular kind, probably one with a high density of middle-income engineers. [&hellip;] But as an educational utopian I want something else. I want to know what kind of computer culture can grow in communities where there is not already a rich technophilic soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      [&hellip;] The obstacle to the growth of popular computer cultures is cultural, for example, the mismatch between the computer culture embedded in the machines of today and the cultures of the homes they will go into. And if the problem is cultural the remedy must be cultural.
     </p>
     <p>
      The research challenge is clear. We need to advance the art of meshing computers with cultures so that they can serve to unite, hopefully without homogenizing, the fragmented subcultures that coexist counterproductively in contemporary society. For example, the gulf must be bridged between the technical-scientific and humanistic cultures. And I think that the key to constructing this bridge will be learning how to recast powerful ideas in computational form, ideas that are as important to the poet as to the engineer.
    </p>

  <span class='lede'>C. Wright Mills</span> was overwhelmingly concerned with the political, moral, &amp; social responsibility of intellectuals in postwar America.  In a preface to <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195133730' class='book'>The Sociological Imagination</a> titled &#8220;On Intellectual Craftsmanship,&#8221; Mills lays  out what he thinks defines Good Work in sociology.  We find it pretty inspiring.
</p>

<p>
  We are deeply interested in how people learn.  We believe there&#8217;s much to be gained from the ethnographer&#8217;s lens.  When we squint just right, we find that we&#8217;re surrounded by dispatches from the future of learning.
</p>

<p>
  And that&#8217;s how these notes are intended: our attempts to pick out the bits and pieces from our day-to-day worth polishing up as we learn about learning.  We thought it appropriate to kick off these notes with a bit of an homage to Mills&mdash;what follows is the result of liberally mixing, matching, excerpting, and tweaking &#8220;On Intellectual Craftsmanship.&#8221;

  <p>
    To the <a href='http://thesprouts.tumblr.com/post/38192931792/but-utility-was-only-one-of-the-historical-reasons'>mathetic</a> designer who feels to be part of the classic tradition, designing learning tools &amp; experiences is above all the practice of a <em>craft</em>. At work on problems of substance, you are among those who are quickly made impatient and weary by elaborate discussions of method-and-theory-in-general; so much of it interrupts your proper studies. It is much better, you believe, to have one account by a working student of how you are going about your work than a dozen &#8216;codifications of procedure&#8217; by specialists who as often as not have never done much work of consequence. Only by conversations in which experienced thinkers exchange information about their actual ways of working can a useful sense of method and theory be imparted.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is best to begin, I think, by reminding you that the most admirable thinkers within the community you have chosen to join do not split their work from their lives. They seem to take both too seriously to allow such dissociation, and they want to use each for the enrichment of the other. Of course, such a split is the prevailing convention, deriving, I suppose, from the hollowness of the work in general now done. But you will have recognized that you have the exceptional opportunity of designing a way of living which will encourage the habits of good workmanship. Scholarship is a choice of how to live as well as a choice of career; whether they know it or not, the intellectual worker forms their own self as they work toward the perfection of his craft; to realize their own potentialities, and any opportunities that come their way, they construct a character which has at its core the qualities of the good workman.
  </p>

  <p>
    What this means is that <em>you must learn to use your life experience in your intellectual work</em>: continually to examine and interpret it. In this sense craftsmanship is the center of yourself and you are personally involved in every intellectual product upon which you may work. To say that you can have experience, means, for one thing, that your past plays into and affects your present, and that it defines your capacity for future experience. As a mathetic designer, you have to control this rather elaborate interplay, to capture what you experience and sort it out; only in this way can you hope to use it to guide and test your reflection, and in the process shape yourself as an intellectual craftsman. But how can you do this? One answer is: you must set up a blog, which is, I suppose, a designer&#8217;s way of saying: keep a journal. Many creative writers keep journals; your need for systematic reflection demands it.
  </p>

  <p>
    In such a blog as I am going to describe, there is joined personal experience and professional activities, studies under way and studies planned. In this blog, you, as an intellectual craftsman, will try to get together what you are doing intellectually and what you are experiencing as a person. Here you will not be afraid to use your experience and relate it directly to various work in progress.  Your blog encourages you to capture &#8216;fringe-thoughts:&#8217; various ideas which may be byproducts of everyday life, snatches of conversation overheard on the street, or, for that matter, dreams. Once noted, these may lead to more systematic thinking, as well as lend intellectual relevance to more directed experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will have often noticed how carefully accomplished thinkers treat their own minds, how closely they observe their development and organize their experience. The reason they treasure their smallest experiences is that, in the course of a lifetime, modern man has so very little personal experience and yet experience is so important as a source of original intellectual work. To be able to trust yet to be skeptical of your own experience, I have come to believe, is one mark of the mature workman. This ambiguous confidence is indispensable to originality in any intellectual pursuit, and the blog is one way by which you can develop and justify such confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    By keeping an adequate blog and thus developing self-reflective habits, you learn how to keep your inner world awake. Whenever you feel strongly about events or ideas you must try not to let them pass from your mind, but instead to formulate them for your files and in so doing draw out their implications, show yourself either how foolish these feelings or ideas are, or how they might be articulated into productive shape. The blog also helps you build up the habit of writing. You cannot &#8216;keep your hand in&#8217; if you do not write something at least every week. In developing the blog, you can experiment as a writer and thus, as they say, develop your powers of expression.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the very worst things that happens to educators is that they feel the need to write of their plans&#8217; on only one occasion: when they are going to ask for money for a specific piece of research or &#8216;a project.&#8217; It is as a request for funds that most &#8216;planning&#8217; is done, or at least carefully written about. However standard the practice, I think this very bad: It is bound in some degree to be salesmanship, and, given prevailing expectations, very likely to result in painstaking pretensions; the project is likely to be presented, rounded out in some arbitrary manner long before it ought to be; it is often a contrived thing, aimed at getting the money for ulterior purposes, however valuable, as well as for the research presented. A practicing mathetic designer ought periodically to review the state of their problems and plans. A young investigator, just at the beginning of their independent work, ought to reflect on this, but they cannot be expected&mdash;and shouldn&#8217;t expect themselves&mdash;to get very far with it, and certainly they ought not to become rigidly committed to any one plan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any working designer who is well on his way ought at all times to have so many plans, which is to say ideas, that the question is always, which of them am I, ought I, to work on next? And you should keep a special little file for your master agenda, which you write and rewrite just for yourself and perhaps for discussion with friends. From time to time you ought to review this very carefully and purposefully, and sometimes too, when you is relaxed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some such procedure is one of the indispensable means by which your intellectual enterprise is kept oriented and under control. A widespread, informal interchange of such reviews of &#8216;the state of my problems&#8217; among working mathetic designers is, I suggest, the only basis for an adequate statement of the leading problems of mathetic design. It is unlikely that in any free intellectual community there would be and certainly there ought not to be any &#8216;monolithic&#8217; array of problems. In such a community, were it flourishing in a vigorous way, there would be interludes of discussion among individuals about future work. Three kinds of interludes&mdash;on problems, methods, theory&mdash;ought to come out of the work of mathetic designers, and lead into it again; they should be shaped by work-in-progress and to some extent guide that work. It is for such interludes that a professional association finds its intellectual reason for being. And for them too your own blog is needed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Under various topics in your blog there are ideas, personal notes, excerpts from books, bibliographical items and outlines of projects. It is, I suppose, a matter of arbitrary habit, but I think you will find it well to sort all these items into a master blog of &#8216;projects,&#8217; with many subdivisions. The topics, of course, change, sometimes quite frequently.  In fact, the use of the blog encourages expansion of the categories which you use in your thinking. And the way in which these categories change, some being dropped and others being added-is an index of your intellectual progress and breadth. Eventually, the blog will come to be arranged according to several large projects, having many sub-projects that change from year to year.
  </p>

  <p>
    All this involves the taking of notes. You will have to acquire the habit of taking a large volume of notes from any worth-while book you read&mdash;although, I have to say, you may get better work out of yourself when you read really bad books. The first step in translating experience&mdash;either of others&#8217; writing&mdash;or of your own life, into the intellectual sphere, is to give it form. Merely to name an item of experience often invites you to explain it; the mere taking of a note from a book is often a prod to reflection. At the same time, of course, the taking of a note is a great aid in comprehending what you are reading.
  </p>

  <p>
    But how is this blog&mdash;which so far must seem to you more like a curious sort of &#8216;literary&#8217; journal&mdash;used in intellectual production? The maintenance of such a blog <em>is</em> intellectual production. It is a continually growing store of facts and ideas, from the most vague to the most finished.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the intellectual condition of the learning sciences today, there is so much to do by way of initial &#8216;structuring&#8217; (let the word stand for the kind of work I am describing) that much &#8216;empirical research&#8217; is bound to be thin and uninteresting. Much of it, in fact, is a formal exercise for beginning students, and sometimes a useful pursuit for those who are not able to handle the more difficult substantive problems of social science. There is no more virtue in empirical inquiry as such than in reading as such. The purpose of empirical inquiry is to settle disagreements and doubts about facts, and thus to make arguments more fruitful by basing all sides more substantively. Facts discipline reason; but reason is the advance guard in any field of learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although you may never be able to get the money with which to do many of the empirical studies you design, it is necessary that you continue designing them. For once you lay out an empirical study, even if you do not follow it through, it leads you to a new search for data, which often turn out to have unsuspected relevance to your problems. Just as it is foolish to design a field study if the answer can be found in a library, it is foolish to think you have exhausted the books before you have translated them into appropriate empirical studies, which merely means into questions of fact.
  </p>

  <p>
    Empirical projects must promise, first, to have relevance for the first draft, they have to confirm it in its original form or they have to cause its modification. Or to put it more pretentiously, they must have implications for theoretical constructions. Second, the projects must be efficient and neat and, if possible, ingenious. By this I mean that they must promise to yield a great deal of material in proportion to the time and effort they involve. But how is this to be done? The most economical way to state a problem is in such a way as to solve as much of it as possible by reasoning alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    By reasoning we try (a) to isolate each question of fact that remains; (b) to ask these questions of fact in such ways that the answers promise to help us solve further problems by further reasoning.  To take hold of problems in this way, you have to pay attention to four stages; but it is usually best to go through all four many times rather than to get stuck in any one of them too long. The steps are:
  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        the elements and definitions that, from your general awareness of the topic, issue, or area of concern, you think you are going to have to take into account;
      </li>
      <li>
        the logical relations between these definitions and elements; building these little preliminary models, by the way, affords the best chance for the play of the sociological imagination;
      </li>
      <li id='elimination-of-false-views'>
        the elimination of false views due to omissions of needed elements, improper or unclear definitions of terms, or undue emphasis on some part of the range and its logical extensions
      </li>
      <li>
        statement and re-statement of the questions of fact that remain.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <p>
    The <a href='#elimination-of-false-views'>third step</a>, by the way, is a very necessary but often neglected part of any adequate statement of a problem. The popular awareness of the problem&mdash;the problem as an issue and as a trouble&mdash;must be carefully taken into account: that is part of the problem. Scholarly statements, of course, must be carefully examined and either used up in the re-statement being made, or thrown out.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know we will agree that we should present your work in as clear and simple language as your subject and your thought about it permit. But as you may have noticed, a turgid and polysyllabic prose does seem to prevail in the learning sciences. I suppose those who use it believe they are imitating &#8216;physical science,&#8217; and are not aware that much of that prose is not altogether necessary. It has in fact been said with authority that there is &#8216;a serious crisis in literacy&#8217;&mdash;a crisis in which learning scientists are very much involved. Is this peculiar language due to the fact that profound and subtle issues, concepts, methods, are being discussed? If not, then what are the reasons for it?
  </p>

  <p>
    Such lack of ready intelligibility, I believe, usually has little or nothing to do with the complexity of subject matter, and nothing at all with profundity of thought. It has to do almost entirely with certain confusions of the academic writer about their own status.
  </p>

  <p>
    In many academic circles today anyone who tries to write in a widely intelligible way is liable to be condemned as a &#8216;mere literary man&#8217; or, worse still, &#8216;a mere journalist.&#8217; Perhaps you have already learned that these phrases, as commonly used, only indicate the spurious inference: superficial-because-readable. The academic man in America is trying to carry on a serious intellectual life in a social context that often seems quite set against it. His prestige must make up for many of the dominant values he has sacrificed by choosing an academic career. His claims for prestige readily become tied to his self-image as a &#8216;scientist.&#8217; To be called a &#8216;mere journalist&#8217; makes him feel undignified and shallow. It is this situation, I think, that is often at the bottom of the elaborate vocabulary and involved manner of speaking and writing. It is less difficult to learn this manner than not. It has become a convention&mdash;those who do not use it are subject to moral disapproval. It may be that it is the result of an academic closing of the ranks on the part of the mediocre, who understandably wish to exclude those who win the attention of intelligent people, academic and otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
    To write is to raise a claim for the attention of readers. That is part of any style. To write is also to claim for oneself at least status enough to be read. Young academics are very much involved in both claims, and because they feel their lack of public position, they often put the claim for their own status before their claim for the attention of the reader to what they are saying. In fact, in America, even the most accomplished men of knowledge do not have much status among wide circles and publics. In this respect, the case of education has been an extreme one: in large part habits of style stem from the time when educators had little status even with other academic men. Desire for status is one reason why academics slip so readily into unintelligibility. And that, in turn, is one reason why they do not have the status they desire. A truly vicious circle&mdash;but one out of which any mathetic designer can easily break.
  </p>

  <p>
    To overcome the academic <em>prose</em> you have first to overcome the academic <em>pose</em>.  It is much less important to study grammar and Anglo-Saxon roots than to clarify your own answers to these three questions:
  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        How difficult and complex after all is my subject? (<em>Very difficult, but not very complex at all.  After all, everyone learns!</em>)
      </li>
      <li>
        When I write, what status am I claiming for myself? (<em>Just that of another learner and occasionally another designer who has spent some time paying attention to how people learn and how we might better support learning.</em>)
      </li>
      <li>
        For whom am I trying to write? (<em>First of all, for others working to create compelling learning experiences.  And secondly, for learners and the people who care about them.</em>)
      </li>
    </ol>

  <p>
    From what I have said, you will understand that in practice we never &#8216;start working on a project;&#8217; we are already &#8216;working,&#8217; either in a personal vein, in the files, in taking notes after browsing, or in guided endeavors. Following this way of living and working, we will always have many topics that we want to work out further. After we decide on some &#8216;release,&#8217; we will try to use our entire blog, our browsing in libraries, our conversation, our selections of people&mdash;all for this topic or theme. We are trying to build a little world containing all the key elements which enter into the work at hand, to put each in its place in a systematic way, continually to readjust this framework around developments in each part of it. Merely to live in such a constructed world is to know what is needed: ideas, facts, ideas, figures, ideas.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thinking is a struggle for order and at the same time for comprehensiveness. We must not stop thinking too soon&mdash;or we will fail to know all that we should; we cannot leave it to go on forever, or we  will burst. It is this dilemma, I suppose, that makes reflection, on those rare occasions when it is more or less successful, the most passionate endeavor of which the human being is capable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Perhaps I can best summarize what I have been trying to say in the form of a few precepts and cautions:
</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <em>Be a good craftsman: Avoid any rigid set of procedures. Above all, seek to develop and to use the sociological imagination.</em> Avoid the fetishism of method and technique. Urge the rehabilitation of the unpretentious intellectual craftsman, and try to become such a craftsman yourself. Let every man be his own methodologist; let every man be his own theorist; let theory and method again become part of the practice of a craft. Stand for the primacy of the individual scholar; stand opposed to the ascendancy of research teams of technicians. Be one mind that is on its own confronting the problems of man and society.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Urge upon yourself and upon others the simplicity of clear statement.</em> Use more elaborated terms only when you believe firmly that their use enlarges the scope of your sensibilities, the precision of your references, the depth of your reasoning. Avoid using unintelligibility as a means of evading the making of judgments upon society-and as a. means of escaping your readers&#8217; judgments upon your own work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Examine in detail little facts and their relations, and big unique events as well. But do not be fanatic: relate all such work, continuously and closely, to the level of historical reality. Do not assume that somebody else will do this for you, sometime, somewhere. Take as your task the defining of this reality; formulate your problems in its terms; on its level try to solve these problems and thus resolve the issues and the troubles they incorporate. <em>And never write more than three pages without at least having in mind a solid example.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Do not study merely one small milieu after another; study the social structures in which milieu are organized.</em> In terms of these studies of larger structures, select the milieux you need to study in detail, and study them in such a way as to understand the interplay of milieux with structure. Proceed in a similar way in so far as the span of time is concerned. Do not be merely a journalist, however precise a one. Know that journalism can be a great intellectual endeavor, but know also that yours is greater! So do not merely report minute researches into static knife-edge moments, or very short-term runs of time. Take as your time-span the course of human history, and locate within it the weeks, years, epochs you examine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Realize that your aim is a fully comparative understanding of mathetics that have appeared and that do now exist in world history.</em> Realize that to carry it out you must avoid the arbitrary specialization of prevailing academic departments. Specialize your work variously, according to topic, and above all according to significant problem. In formulating and in trying to solve these problems, do not hesitate, indeed seek, continually and imaginatively, to draw upon the perspectives and materials, the ideas and methods, of any and all sensible studies of man and society. They are your studies; they are part of what you are a part of; do not let them be taken from you by those who would close them off by weird jargon and pretensions of expertise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Know that you inherit and are carrying on a tradition of classic social analysis</em>; so try to understand man not as an isolated fragment, not as an intelligible field or system in and of itself. Try to understand men and women as historical and social actors, and the ways in which the variety of men and women are intricately selected and intricately formed by the variety of human societies. Before you are through with any piece of work, no matter how indirectly on occasion, orient it to the central and con- tinuing task of understanding the structure and the drift, the shaping and the meanings, of your own period, the terrible and magnificent world of human society in the second half of the twentieth century.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Do not allow public issues as they are officially formulated, or troubles as they are privately felt, to determine the problems that you take up for study.</em> Above all, do not give up your moral and political autonomy by accepting in somebody else&#8217;s terms the illiberal practicality of the bureaucratic ethos or the liberal practicality of the moral scatter. Know that many personal troubles cannot be solved merely as troubles, but must be understood in terms of public issues -and in terms of the problems of history- making. Know that the human meaning of public issues must be revealed by relating them to personal troubles-and to the problems of the individual life. Know that the problems of social science, when adequately formulated, must include both troubles and issues, both biography and history, and the range of their intricate relations. Within that range the life of the individual and the making of societies occur; and within that range the sociological imagination has its chance to make a difference in the quality of human life in our time.
      </li>
