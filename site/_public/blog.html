      For some school is a place and others it is a process.  For all, it is an institution. And by definition, institutions need rituals.  To most, these rituals seem the mechanics enabling school&#8217;s nominal goal: knowledge transfer.  But habits can define us, and perhaps the cumulative effects of the texture of our time are even more important than what we get done during that time in the first place.

      <p>
  Every morning, I brush my teeth. &#8220;One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.&#8221; I brush in multiples of seven. I shift the toothbrush over one tooth. &#8220;One, two, three, four, five, six seven.&#8221; And I repeat. I do the same for the insides and tops of my teeth. &#8220;One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.&#8221; Then I spit and brush my tongue. &#8220;One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.&#8221; I take a gulp of water, swish seven times, and spit it out. Every morning.
</p>

<p>
  This is a habit. I formed it intentionally. While I&#8217;m brushing my teeth&mdash;despite the fact I keep count&mdash;my mind wanders&hellip;to my dreams, the day ahead, the day behind. This habit serves to <em>free</em> my attention; it lets me <em>focus</em> on other things while I brush my teeth.
</p>

<p>
  Every evening (except for Saturday), I draft a wilt. &#8220;wilt&#8221; stands for &#8220;what i learned today.&#8221; It&#8217;s an email with five bullet points. Three of those bullet points are observations about what I thought or learned that day. Two of them are wirts, i.e. &#8220;what i read today.&#8221; I send this email out to the same people, every day.
</p>

<p>
  This is a habit. I formed it intentionally. While I&#8217;m wilting, however, I am thinking about nothing else; I am processing my day and doing occasionally hard thinking to communicate a new idea. This habit serves to <em>focus</em> my attention; it lets me <em>ignore</em> other things while I write.
</p>

<p>
  I brush my teeth because the health of my teeth matters to me. I don&#8217;t want bad breath. I want to avoid dental bills. I want to avoid being having ugly teeth.
</p>

<p>
  I wilt because of certain ideas I have about my intellectual development. I want to actively reflect on my experience. I want to keep in touch with the small group with whom I wilt. I want to set up a structure encouraging me to read something meaty every day.
</p>

<p>
  Embedded in each of these habits is a set of values. By engaging in these habits, I privilege certain values. I am pushed to embrace those things which pay respect to those values&mdash;or even better, make these habits easier. &#8220;Cleanliness&#8221; or &#8220;intellectual rigor&#8221; or &#8220;easily documented&#8221; or &#8220;interesting to my friends&#8221; or &#8220;attractive to others&#8221;&mdash;each of these, with different weights and emphases, inform and are informed by my habits.
</p>

<p>
  The arrow of causation can go both ways&mdash;not only does each habit carry with it a utility, each habit can inculcate the value of that utility in us. Anyone who has gone to Mass or boot camp can attest to this.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, adopting a habit normalizes certain expectations about how you handle &#8220;that type of thing.&#8221; Personal hygiene is seen as a collection of small habits like brushing my teeth. Successful first dates, not so much. We think it&#8217;s reasonable that &#8216;staying healthy&#8217; require an hour a day of food and exercise considerations&mdash;even if most of us fall short of that. But, most wouldn&#8217;t think an hour a day of mental health care would be healthy unless it were reframed as something like meditation or family time.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;d like to suggest that we can bring this lens of &#8220;freeing&#8221; and &#8220;focusing&#8221; habits and the expectations they normalize to our experiences as students. Consider the average school day. And in particular, consider its schedule. Few think about patriotism during the Pledge of Allegiance. Few think about obedience when a teacher calls out, <a href="http://www.proteacher.net/discussions/showthread.php?t=510">&#8220;Give me five!&#8221;</a> Some think about algebra during algebra class.
</p>

<p>
  What about the schedule? What messages are embedded in the tempo of a buzzer every forty-seven minutes? Well, many&mdash;e.g. there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465097189">long history</a> of critique digging into the economic and sociological forces defining the institutional logic of a &#8216;period.&#8217; But actually, I&#8217;d like to set aside the various questions about what good learning looks like and what&#8217;s &#8220;necessary&#8221; to teach effectively in &#8220;today&#8217;s world.&#8221; I&#8217;d instead like to focus on a single, concrete side effect: the message we implicitly communicate about the nature of intellectual work. For at least eight years&mdash;just under nine thousand hours in school&mdash;the overwhelming majority of examples and experiences students have &#8216;learning something&#8217; suggest that &#8216;learning&#8217; happens in consistent, well-managed chunks of small, steady applications of effort to do something that someone else has laid out for you. This is the precise opposite of the deep work and focus that we know accompanies real learning.
</p>

<p>
  Again, at the moment I am not concerned with pedagogy&mdash;i.e. with what &#8216;effective teaching&#8217; looks like. Instead, I&#8217;d like to suggest a simple exercise: think through&mdash;minute by minute&mdash;a school day. (If you have a child of your own, even better&mdash;think through <em>their</em> day.) And don&#8217;t think about what the schedule <em>says</em> people do&mdash;i.e. don&#8217;t think, &#8220;Algebra class&#8221;&mdash;think about what you&#8217;d see if you could set up a videocamera and lay over the student&#8217;s thought-track for their day.
</p>

<p>
  Now when I run into a challenging question, my muscle memory tells me to &#8984;-tab to something easier. Sometimes it&#8217;s twitter, sometimes it&#8217;s my email, and most of the time I intercept the impulse. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;d see on my thought track (with a boring video of me staring at my computer, occasionally straightening my posture, and bobbing my head to a beat). These tiny vagaries give my time a texture. So be sure to think about that texture of each minute you imagine&mdash;is it spent deep in thought? Listening? Making something? Talking to someone? Thinking about a crush? Worrying about grades? Worrying about food?
</p>

<p>
  Imagine integrating that habit over time, day-in and day-out, for one thousand days (about how long we spend in 6-12th grade). And importantly, imagine that you <em>never</em> see any other examples of learning. &#8220;Sure, ice skaters and actors and cellists quit school to pursue their craft,&#8221; you think, &#8220;But a) they&#8217;re nuts, b) that&#8217;s like 0.1% of folks, and c) my parents would <em>never</em> go for that.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  Now, consider the following juxtapositions. And for each of these, ask yourself, &#8220;If I were to turn each of these into a habit, what would that feel like? What habits would I develop or need? Following directions? Being playful? Skimming? Working together? Thinking deeply? Do I spend thirty minutes on a page or thirty seconds?&#8221;

<p>
  And finally, if you aren&#8217;t tired of the exercise yet, let&#8217;s turn it around.  Choose a texture of time and activity you would be proud to see yourself (or your child) adopt as their own. Are they sitting in an overstuffed chair smoking a pipe considering Aristotle? Are they waking up at 4A every day to train for a marathon? Are they making sure to get home by 6P every day so they can spend some quality time with <em>their</em> child? Look at their day to day experiences now and consider how (or whether) there&#8217;s any connection at all.
</p>

<p>
  The rhetoric of school centers on of &#8216;preparation.&#8217; Students are immersed in prerequisites for future courses, many of which are unknown. Their participation in classes are themselves an act of preparation for more classes in college or for the workforce. Because cooking dinner is different than eating dinner, it is simple to conclude that <em>preparing</em> for a rich intellectual life should look and feel different than <em>living</em> a rich, intellectual life. But cooking and living are not the same.  And just as spending too much time planning your kids&#8217; activities can change your relationship to them, we should not forget that these habits of preparation do not spin along in a vacuum&mdash;they change us. And that means we should have some very persuasive stories lined up which we can honestly deploy every forty-seven minutes, after each buzzer.

      Most schools look and feel the same, and not because of long evolution under the pressures of &#8216;student-centered design.&#8217;  If biodiversity helps Nature find clever solutions, can it help those of us interested in the future of learning?

      <p>
  Biodiversity helps evolution find new, better solutions faster. And evolution is especially good at finding solutions to multidimensional problems which haven&#8217;t proven susceptible to analysis. &quot;Education&quot; is one of these. Unfortunately, biodiversity is not a priority among reformers. Funding patterns and the hype cycle, among other influences, insure most focus on The Next Big Thing.
</p>

<p>
  In evolution, reproduction is what matters. So what&#8217;s the analogue of &#8216;reproductive success&#8217; for education? Answering that involves an essential discussion about the values and goals of education which I am going to sidestep entirely. Instead, I&#8217;m going to talk about something that&mdash;within our analogy&mdash;is more like &#8216;running fast.&#8217; That is, I want to talk about an activity which we would all agree is adaptive and which we should all hope our educational systems are getting better at nurturing: knowledge work.
</p>

<p>
  In 1957, Peter Drucker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1560006226">wrote</a> (<strong>emphasis</strong> mine):
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      In the United States, where most of the young people in the metropolitan areas go at least to high school, the assembly line is already obsolete. The labor necessary to run it is becoming scarce. Young people with a high school education do not want to work as human machine tools. […] How new these expectations are is shown in the field of personnel management. Only forty years old-it began in World War I&mdash;the discipline is already outdated in its concepts and its assumptions. Its principles, its rules, its practices and procedures all represent a distillation of experience with unskilled or semiskilled machine workers, largely from the metalworking industries. <strong>Today the majority of the personnel employed even in manufacturing industries are no longer of this kind, are rather people doing knowledge work</strong>, however unskilled. How far our personnel management theories really applied even to yesterday&#8217;s machine workers is an open question. For managing tomorrow&#8217;s employees, the products of the educated society, they are likely to be quite inadequate.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

<p>
  &quot;Knowledge work&quot; is work whose main capital is not physical output or labor, but &#8216;knowledge&#8217;, broadly construed. &quot;Knowledge workers&quot; are people who think for a living, and they dominate our economy. Think technologists and engineers and designers and executives. At its best, school is&mdash;quite literally&mdash;filled with &#8216;knowledge work.&#8217; So why do the org charts of tech companies and schools look so different?
</p>

</div>

<p>
  More to the point, why do Google and high school <em>feel</em> so different? Well, Silicon Valley is not the Department of Education. It&#8217;s <span class="caps">OK</span> if the #1 tech company is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(AAPL+profit)%2F(AAPL+operating+expenses)%2F((GOOG+profit)%2F(GOOG+operating+expenses))">five times more profitable than its nearest competitor</a>. But our democratic conscience would not brook the same inequality in our educational system. And a white, tech guy in his thirties is not a poor, brown girl in her teens. Differences abound. Regardless&mdash;if we believe school supports knowledge work&mdash;we should be able to simultaneously acknowledge those differences and explain <em>why</em> school looks and feels the way it does.
</p>

<p>
  There will always be constraints like equity. But saying our educational system will be &#8220;equitable&#8221; tells us no more about how it will look and feel than telling your girlfriend your new haircut&#8217;s &#8220;not too short.&#8221; If we are to design an educational system to support knowledge work, it might make sense to begin with the simple question, &quot;What is knowledge work like?&quot;
</p>

<p>
  Knowledge work is rarely about <em>process</em>. Knowledge work is characterized by the <em>absence</em> of routine&hellip;by a need for changing ratios of creative, convergent, &amp; divergent thinking&hellip;by a combination of working alone and together&hellip;by a <em>resistance</em> to quantitative metrics&hellip;by a focus on brainstorming and iteration and revision…above all, by open-ended questions and uncertainty and risk.
</p>

<p>
  So how does the tech sector&mdash;an epitome of knowledge work&mdash;handle this?
</p>

<p>
  The basic answer is that we are still figuring that out. While there are clearly some themes in how these tech companies support and manage their employees&mdash;an emphasis on intrinsic motivation, flexible work schedules, a focus on small teams and rapid iteration, and so on&mdash;there is still tremendous diversity and turnover in management thinking here. Plenty has been written about the variety and novelty of management structures and philosophies that the past thirty years of high tech industry have created. But I think there&#8217;s an even more important, easy-to-agree upon, meta-lesson here: that diversity is <em>healthy</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Cornet&#8217;s orgchart cartoon is mostly tongue-in-cheek. But every technologist or employee at one of these companies will recognize the kernels of truth in the lampoon. And even simply among the six heavy-hitters you see enormous differences. And that is regarded as <em>healthy</em>&mdash;at no stockholders&#8217; meeting would you hear the claim that there&#8217;s A Universal Org Chart. Minimally, the claim is that collectively, the <em>biodiversity</em> of management structures, product strategy, company culture and so on contribute to a healthy organic process evolving more effective companies.
</p>

<p>
  So what about high schools? How do they accommodate knowledge work?
</p>

<p>
  Well, despite being a much larger, older institution than multinational tech companies with much less control over the problems they&#8217;re tasked with solving&mdash;high schools have basically homogeneous org charts. Of course, these org charts don&#8217;t necessarily reflect reality. And many of them are legally mandated, in one form or another. I don&#8217;t know what the &#8216;right&#8217; org chart is&mdash;if there even is such a thing. But I <em>do</em> know that it&#8217;s important for those of us interested in new models of learning to be able to tell a story about <em>why</em> the space of solutions we&#8217;ve explored looks the way it does so far. And more importantly, why do most schools look and feel the same?
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, if that story doesn&#8217;t tie back to claims about how people learn or what school is for, then perhaps there&#8217;s a new type of reform work to be done. Perhaps there are ways we can change the <em>types</em> of conversations we have instead of simply trumpeting a new message more loudly. This is no simple task. There are many boundary conditions that define the look and feel of school which implicitly define how we talk about school. I&#8217;m going to scratch the surface of just one: the schedule.

<p>
  Knowledge work often requires large, contiguous blocks of time to grapple with open-ended issues and uncertainty. It is trite to complain about the schedule cuts up students&#8217; and teachers&#8217; days. It is trivial to point to burgeoning literature on optimal conditions for learning and productivity and decry the school bell. But <em>why</em> does the schedule look like it does? There are many explanations for this&mdash;<em>e.g.</em> it mimics the factory floor schedule, it is a necessary consequence of &#8216;covering the curriculum,&#8217; and so on. I&#8217;d suggest that all of these reasons stem from exactly two needs: the need for [evidence of] <em>controllability</em> and the need for [evidence of] <em>observability</em>.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;ve lifted these terms from the field of control theory (or simply &#8216;controls&#8217;): a branch of mathematics and engineering that helps us design dynamic systems we can control and regulate. It&#8217;s responsible for your cruise control, your thermostat, and making sure the robotic arms that assemble your car don&#8217;t overshoot when they&#8217;re placing the passenger door. &quot;Controllability&quot; and &quot;observability&quot; are two of the fundamental aspects of a system with which controls engineers concern themselves when looking at a new problem.
</p>

<p>
  &quot;Controllability&quot; refers to our ability to move a system from one state into another (given certain constraints, like power density or efficiency). So if we were talking about your car&#8217;s cruise control, some can cars can get from zero to sixty miles per hour in six seconds, some in three. A Corvette&#8217;s cruise control looks different than a Beetle&#8217;s. &quot;Observability&quot; refers to our ability to look into a system and know what&#8217;s going on, to <em>find out</em> we&#8217;re going fifty so that the cruise control can decide what to do with our gas pedal. So in this cruise control analogy, what&#8217;s school&#8217;s &#8216;speed?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
  Well, <em>curriculum</em> is <a href='http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=curriculum&allowed_in_frame=0'>Latin for race course</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Schools are tasked&mdash;minimally&mdash;with implementing a <em>curriculum</em>. A curriculum is made up of <em>facts</em> and <em>skills</em>. The school&#8217;s job (pedagogically speaking) is to inculcate these facts and skills into students. But remember, schools are governed and managed at scale. So we must acknowledge that school&#8217;s job often reduces to <em>documenting</em> the performance of the curriculum. There are exactly two ways to do this. We can point to the inputs to school and take schooling&#8217;s efficacy on faith. Or, we can point to the outputs of school and take your measurement&#8217;s accuracy on faith. Of course, schools do a combination of these, documenting seat time or credits (inputs) <em>and</em> test scores or <span class="caps">GPA</span> (outputs).
</p>

<p>
  Even when we transcend questions of academic development, the boundary conditions of the conversation around what school looks and feels like is remarkably constant.  Consider a recent (heartbreaking) <a href='http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/487/harper-high-school-part-one'>pair of episodes</a> of <a href='http://www.thisamericanlife.org/'><i>This American Life</i></a> exploring <a href='http://www.harperhighschool.org/'>Harper High School</a> on the South Side of Chicago.  In particular, the episodes explore the deeply destructive effects of gun violence and modern gang culture on youth, staff, and the community at large.  Listening to it, it&#8217;s hard to understand why &#8216;school&#8217; is even in the picture; what you hear sounds more like a refugee camp or shelter for battered folks than an educational institution.  Yet, in discussing the importance of the <a href='http://www.isbe.net/apl/pdf/ipz/proposals/cps_turnaround_lead.pdf'>turnaround funds</a> the state had provided to Harper High School, the entirety of the focus is on the inputs to the system.  What follows is an excerpt from the episode wherein the principal discusses the effect of the turnaround funds on their efforts.  I&#8217;ve <em>highlighted</em> every effect mentioned.
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      One former district official involved in Harper&#8217;s turnaround told me that Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who used to run Chicago&#8217;s schools, he said to his former colleagues, with these new turnaround initiatives, like the one at Harper, he wanted to, quote, &#8220;take the issue of money off the table,&#8221; in other words, give them whatever they need. So the plan was pretty much boost the school with a lot of federal, state, and city money, then as the changes took hold, slowly ramp down the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then five years later, the funding would go back to normal. That&#8217;s next year. Next year is when the money goes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fall, I sat down with Principal Sanders and the school&#8217;s operations manager to talk about all this. They told me the money has done so much. There&#8217;s a new <em>culinary learning room</em>, new <em>computer equipment</em>, small stuff like a <em>new <span class="caps">ID</span> machine</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Principal Sanders talks about the first year of turnaround like it was amazing. There were <em>four assistant principals</em>, <em>reduced class sizes</em>. There was the kind of support staf&mdash;social workers and counselors&mdash;in numbers that other schools only dream of.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  This is the entirety of the discussion of the aggregate efficacy of the turnaround program.  I do not mean to critique Harper High or even question the efficacy of the interventions Principal Sanders lauds.  Not only do I have nothing against new computer equipment, but I even suspect it helped!  I do, however, mean to highlight the <i>rhetoric</i> that dominates the conversation.  For some set of folks&mdash;certainly for the elite, upper middle class folks that flow through <i>Teach for America</i> whose ilk will dominate policy and decisionmaking circles&mdash;<i>This American Life</i> is a reasonable place to look for the mainstream conversation.  This focus on inputs would make sense under a constant theory of change.  <i>e.g.</i> if the Red Cross talks about how useful bandages and bottled water and doctors are, we don&#8217;t balk because we have a deeply held (and widely corroborated) model of what &#8216;disaster relief&#8217; looks like.  As such, when we doubt institutions like the Red Cross, we doubt their stewardship, management, and efficiency&mdash;not their strategy.
</p>
<p>
  Yet, just a few minutes earlier in the program, a social worker at Harper confesses that it doesn&#8217;t seem like anything has changed in the past twenty years:
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Alex Kotlowitz</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crystal&#8217;s been working towards a second master&#8217;s degree, and in one of her classes this year has been reading a book I wrote over 20 years ago called <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385265565'><i>There Are No Children Here</i></a>, where I follow two brothers living in the projects on Chicago&#8217;s West Side. For a couple of years, I followed the boys as they grappled with violence, poverty, and the gangs. And Crystal wonders if reading it isn&#8217;t adding to her stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style='font-weight: bold;'>Crystal Smith</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was really interesting, though. To think that 20 years later, nothing has changed, that&#8217;s the scarier part.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  This feeling of stasis makes the focus on inputs all the more striking.
</p>

<p>
  Let&#8217;s set aside any doubts about either the efficacy of our methods or measurements and take a moment to notice how the system of grade levels, curricula, grades, class periods, and credits make it extraordinarily easy to <em>document</em> our inputs and outputs. If you had a pile of skills and facts that you had to disburse at a certain rate in a certain order and document that process, you can see how easily we might make an argument for the current schedule structure. This also gives us some insight into the enthusiasm with which &#8216;flipping the classroom&#8217; and &#8216;data-driven education&#8217; and &#8216;personalized learning&#8217; have been taken up by education reformers. Each of these efforts&mdash;in their own way&mdash;renders the learning process legible while simultaneously making the management of schooling easier. There&#8217;s very little tying any of these structures&mdash;including the traditional class schedule&mdash;to the needs of learners. There is a great deal tying these structures to the needs of the school.
</p>

<p>
  And so now we have plenty of reform wherein the party line&mdash;say, &quot;Learning happens through curricula which are broadcast through classes&quot;&mdash;is never articulated, but assumed. Then, vigorous debate and innovation and incubation are encouraged <em>within</em> those boundaries. And perhaps, more than Another Big Thing, we simply need a lot more space to grow some Small Things that needn&#8217;t satisfy those boundary conditions, <em>a priori</em>.
</p>

<p>
  I will finish with <a href="http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/david-foster-wallace-in-his-own-words?page=full">David Foster Wallace</a>,
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says &quot;Morning, boys. How&#8217;s the water?&quot; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes &quot;What the hell is water?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a standard requirement of <span class="caps">US</span> commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. This story turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you&#8217;re worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don&#8217;t be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.

      An overweening preoccupation with tools is the mark of an amateur.  The notion of a &#8220;best tool&#8221; inevitably producing &#8220;good work&#8221; is a distraction at best.  And in some, amateurish corners of programming culture, it&#8217;s a real obstacle to good learning.

  Too often, school reframes learning as skill- and fact-acquisiton.  At best this creates a blindspot to the various metacognitive dispositions and disciplines which define good learning.  At worst, it leaves learners predisposed to externalize all difficulties (&#8220;My teacher sucked.&#8221;) or internalize all difficulties solely in the language of skills (&#8220;I never was a math person.&#8221;)  Both leave the learner disabled.  Despite the fact that school has mostly failed to integrate computation into its world, in the course of our work we stub our toe on the projection of students&#8217; notions of &#8216;how learning works&#8217; all the time.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But I heard C++ was the best programming language!&quot; he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  And it is <em>always</em> a he. Typically, he hasn&#8217;t really ever <em>made</em> anything with computers, yet. And often, he doesn&#8217;t even know know anyone who has.  Although, his dad usually works in some sort of technical-cum-corporate role&hellip;maybe as a <span class="caps">CIO</span> or <span class="caps">CTO</span> or computer science professor.  Importantly, it&#8217;s rare that his father has written a real piece of code in years.  Regardless, this guy has made sure that his son grows up conflating &#8216;hard&#8217; &amp; &#8216;good.&#8217; The honest oversimplification, &quot;Some use C++ when optimizing performance,&quot; seals the deal. <em>This</em> ten year old, this aspiring software engineer, is going to learn to program in C++, because those things which are fast and hard and somewhat brutal are good (or at least, they&#8217;re for boys, and they&#8217;re certainly for <em>this</em> boy).
</p>

<p>
  Needless to say, he hasn&#8217;t found his way <em>into</em> programming, yet. Perhaps he&#8217;s downloaded <a href="http://unity3d.com">Unity</a> because he read a review that said it was a big deal in game development. Or maybe he persuaded his dad to buy him Microsoft Visual Studio for Christmas and spent the morning installing the 10GB <span class="caps">IDE.</span> And maybe he even got &quot;Hello World!&quot; out of the deal.  But for the most part, he&#8217;s a consumer&mdash;like the rest of us&mdash;though perhaps a little more assiduous a consumer of computer <em>culture</em>, too.
</p>

<p>
  But despite all of this, computers are <em>hugely</em> important in his world. He&#8217;s grown up around them. He sees them at the center of culture near (in video games, which also matter deeply to him) and far (in the Pixar films or Facebook <span class="caps">IPO</span> on <span class="caps">CNN</span> he sees with his family). That is, he has fallen in love with <em>the idea of computers</em>. Unfortunately, actual computer culture offers pretty slim pickings [for kids]&mdash;even nowadays. And so now, after a few years of modding his computer case and finagling <a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/">Maximum <span class="caps">PC</span></a> from his mom when they go to the grocery store and competitively reciting features &amp; acronyms from Apple&#8217;s latest product release, he&#8217;s ended up in a room with me and a handful of other kids. And we&#8217;re making stuff, on computers. Sometimes its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262510375">art</a>, sometimes its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262510375">math</a>&mdash; Usually with <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">LOGO</a> or <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> or <a href="http://nodebox.net/">NodeBox</a>; it doesn&#8217;t really matter how.  And inevitably, in the face of difficulty, the complaint bubbles to the surface, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t working because [the tool] sucks.  Why can&#8217;t we use C++?  Isn&#8217;t that the best?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  If the kids are young enough, I&#8217;m a compelling enough character to persuade them that their search for &#8216;the best programming language&#8217; is meaningless. Sometimes I can pull out <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/steve-jobs-in-1994-the-rolling-stone-interview-20110117?print=true">Steve Jobs</a>, or if they&#8217;re really invested, <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">Pete Norvig</a> or <a href="http://paulgraham.com/langdes.html">Paul Graham</a>. But more often than not, it takes another kid&mdash;someone explicitly <em>not</em> technical, often a <em>she</em>&mdash;to deprogram this fixation. When <em>she</em> makes a more interesting game or solves a problem <em>he</em> struggled with or maybe just obviously complains less than him, something clicks. And at that moment, he&#8217;s in a very fragile place. His ego is vulnerable &amp; open. He can reject the situation&mdash;calling it &#8216;dumb&#8217; or &#8216;just for kids&#8217; or a &#8216;waste of time&#8217;&mdash;or he can embrace it.  And ultimately, that&#8217;s a big part of my job.

      A language is an interface between programmers and hardware, so it has social/psychological/pedagogical features which are just as important as its formal properties. If a language can&#8217;t be efficiently ported on regular hardware, it&#8217;s the language that sucks, not the hardware. Similarly, if it doesn&#8217;t interface properly with its communities of coders (fails to build up standard coding practices, good libraries, trust&hellip;), the language sucks, not the people. Ergo Lisp sucks. Many Lisp zealots dismiss the language&#8217;s failures as &quot;merely social&quot;, but that&#8217;s missing the purpose of a language entirely: failing socially is just as bad as failing technically.

<p>
  So ultimately, computer languages are tools.  Meaning the cultural barriers to entry surrounding those tools matter just as much as the affordances the tools themselves provide.  And it is amidst the ramifications of this fact that most of the interesting and important work expanding our computational fluency is to be done.  Take video games.  Video games are incredibly prominent in the world of children (<em>i.e.</em> boys).  This has meant that video games have become a real entry point to computation for many [boys].
</p>
<p>
  We should not be looking to &#8216;bring [the poor, the brown, the female] to computation.&#8217;  We should be bring computation to the ideas and problems and cultures which matter <em>to them</em>. Seymour Papert was trumpeting this idea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465046746">in 1980</a>.  Writing about Brazil&#8217;s <em>samba schools</em>[community dancehalls where dancing is a community practice]:
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      There are problems with the image of samba schools as the locus of education. I am sure that a computational samba school will catch on somewhere. But the first one will almost certainly happen in a community of a particular kind, probably one with a high density of middle-income engineers. [&hellip;] But as an educational utopian I want something else. I want to know what kind of computer culture can grow in communities where there is not already a rich technophilic soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      [&hellip;] The obstacle to the growth of popular computer cultures is cultural, for example, the mismatch between the computer culture embedded in the machines of today and the cultures of the homes they will go into. And if the problem is cultural the remedy must be cultural.
     </p>
     <p>
      The research challenge is clear. We need to advance the art of meshing computers with cultures so that they can serve to unite, hopefully without homogenizing, the fragmented subcultures that coexist counterproductively in contemporary society. For example, the gulf must be bridged between the technical-scientific and humanistic cultures. And I think that the key to constructing this bridge will be learning how to recast powerful ideas in computational form, ideas that are as important to the poet as to the engineer.
