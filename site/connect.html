  <h2>Our Studios</h2>
  <div class='section-summary'>
  <p>
    Our studios are a place for us to prototype <a href='/work'>our projects and programs</a>.  They have a mix of light manufacturing, basic wet lab, electrical engineering, and arts &amp; crafts supplies and equipment.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the past, we've opened them up to the community as much is convenient.  This past year we welcomed <a href='http://partsandcrafts.org/'>Parts &amp; Crafts</a> to share our space for a few months as they experiment with their Semiconducted Learning Center.  Between that and pending renovations, we've temporarily closed our studios to drop-in, public use.  We plan to re-open them next spring; if you're interested in staying abreast of the schedule, <a href='#newsletter'>sign up for our newsletter</a> or <a href='http://twitter.com/sprouts'>follow @sprouts</a>.

  <p>
    That said, if you think they'd be useful to you&mdash;especially if you've got a meetup or event or community group looking for a venue&mdash;<a href='mailto:three.two.one-contact@thesprouts.org'>let us know</a>!  We'd love to help out.
