<p>Bring Your Grandma to Math Day is an annual event sprout hosts in partnership with the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/museum/">MIT Museum</a> exploring the mathematics behind the playful mathematics underlying board games, origami, geometric puzzles, and more.  The focus is bringing multiple generations, families, and neighborhoods together to explore mathematics as mathematicians often practice it---playfully, through games, puzzles, &amp; creative projects.
