	During this April vacation camp, we worked with <a href="http://www.codmanacademy.org/">Codman Academy</a> students to learn about and play around with how we can use computer programming to make creative projects. Starting with the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, we created our own memes, avatars, and animated self portraits. We looked at examples of compelling artwork and other creative projects done with these digital tools, and then began work designing and developing projects of our own design. Final work included everything from personal websites to animations to special effects to birthday cards.
